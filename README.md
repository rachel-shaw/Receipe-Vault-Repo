# Recipe-Vault-Repo
 The Recipe Vault, created and displayed in Obsidian, is a well-organized digital collection of hundreds of recipes, designed for relatively seamless viewing on a kitchen monitor. Utilizing Obsidianâ€™s powerful linking, tagging, and visualization capabilities, this system enhances accessibility and efficiency in the kitchen. No more spilling ingredients on your favorite paper recipe!

If you haven't already, you will need to download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). This is a free program that uses markdown files to create notes. It is available for all common operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).

In addition to Obsidian, you will also need to download the following plugins and snippets:
## Community Plugins Required:
You will need to download these plugins, but it is easy through obsidian. Click on Settings --> Community plugins --> Browse and search for these. The theme will be found under Settings --> Appearance.
- [Dataview]([**obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview**](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview))
	- You will want to go to dataview properties and toggle "Enable JavaScript queries" and "Enable inline JavaScript queries" on.

## How To Use
Obsidian is simple enough to use. If you haven't used it before, I suggest you familiarize yourself with this fantastic program (YouTube has some great videos) and the [Recipe View]([obsidian://show-plugin?id=recipe-view](obsidian://show-plugin?id=recipe-view)) plugin. When you are ready and have the plugins and snippets installed, click on the Menu markdown file within Obsidian and select the meal you would like to make.
