# Recipe-Vault
 The Recipe Vault, created and displayed in Obsidian, is a well-organized digital collection of hundreds of recipes, designed for seamless viewing on a kitchen monitor. Utilizing Obsidianâ€™s powerful linking, tagging, and visualization capabilities, this system enhances accessibility and efficiency in the kitchen.

## How To Use
Obsidian is simple enough to use. If you haven't used it before, I suggest you familiarize yourself with this fantastic program (YouTube has some great videos) and the [Recipe View]([obsidian://show-plugin?id=recipe-view](obsidian://show-plugin?id=recipe-view)) plugin. When you are ready and have the plugins and snippets installed, click on the Menu markdown file within Obsidian and select the meal you would like to make.
