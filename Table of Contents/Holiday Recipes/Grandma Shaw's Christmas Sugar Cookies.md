This recipe is from Grandma Shaw, who made these every Christmas for the family. They are soft and best kept in the freezer. So good and brings back so many memories.

## Ingredients
**Ingredients for Cookies**
- 1 ½ cup white sugar
- 1 cup Crisco
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ tsp baking powder
- 3 cups flour
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 tsp baking soda

**Frosting (or follow recipe in red Better Homes cookbook for butter frosting (pg.178, ½ serving)**
- 3-4 cups powdered sugar
- Little less than 1/2 stick butter, softened
- Milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Food coloring


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, with rack placed in middle of oven.
2.     In a large mixing bowl, mix together white sugar, Crisco, salt, eggs, and vanilla extract.
3.     In a separate bowl, mix together baking powder and flour.
4.     In a third bowl, mix together buttermilk and baking soda.
5.     Slowly alternate adding flour mixture and buttermilk mixture to large mixing bowl, stirring in between, until soft dough forms. Dough will be VERY sticky.
6.     Scatter additional cup of flour onto counter.
7.     Lightly roll ½ of batter out on counter, until ¼ inch thick. May need to knead flour into dough until able to handle and roll.
8.     Flour cookie cutters, cut cookies out and place on cookie sheet.
9.     Place in oven for 10 mins, or until _very_ lightly brown.
10.  Place on parchment paper to cool.
11.  Mix together ingredients for frosting, dividing into separate bowls per color. Do not add too much liquid as food coloring will thin out mixture.
12.  Frost cookies when cool and store in freezer.

## Notes
Keep in freezer, no need to thaw out before enjoying!
