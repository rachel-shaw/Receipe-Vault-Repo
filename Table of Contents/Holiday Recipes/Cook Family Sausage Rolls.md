Sausage rolls are like the United Kingdom’s version of pigs in a blanket — but way better. Sausage rolls were traditionally made with a lard-based flaky shortcrust pastry, but nowadays they’re most often made with puff pastry. So unless you are keen to make [puff pastry](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-puff-pastry-222312) or shortcrust pastry from scratch, buying store-bought ready-rolled puff pastry sheets work perfectly.

This recipe is from Denise and is a Cook Family tradition Thanksgiving and Christmas mornings.

## Ingredients
- 1 package Jimmy Dean sausage (country mild or regular)
- 1 package Pilsbury Pastry Puff (frozen)


## Directions
1. Take pastry puff out of freezer and place in refrigerator to thaw overnight.
2. Preheat over to 425 degrees (no convection).
3. Place pastry on counter to thaw while oven is preheating (around 15 mins).
4. Roll out pastry puff fairly thin in as much of a rectangle as possible. Be gentle otherwise it does not flake properly when cooked.  
5. Then take a small bowl of flour, flour hands and take the sausage and roll into thin snakes, which I place along the top edge of the rolled out pastry, leaving enough to seal over the sausage.  
6. Brush where you want to seal it with milk and seal.  
7. Then I cut into approximately one inch size rolls and place on a cookie sheet.  No need to butter as there is more than enough fat in the pastry to not stick.
8. Bake for 15 mins or until crispy on top.
## Notes
Do not use convection on oven.
Remember to thaw the night before.

Don't be afraid to use more sausage when rolling. More sausage, the better.
