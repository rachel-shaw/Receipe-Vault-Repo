## Ingredients
- 1.5 cups water
- ½ cup sugar
- 1 sliced orange
- 10 whole cloves
- 2 four inch cinnamon sticks
- 750 ml bottle of red wine (we usually use a cheap Cabernet Sauvignon)
- ¼ cup brandy


## Directions
1. In a large saucepan, combine water, sugar, spices, and <u>half</u> of the orange slices.
2. Bring to a boil, simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
3. Discard spices. Add wine, brandy, and the remaining orange slices.
4. Heat through, but do not boil.
5. Transfer to crock pot (set on ‘keep warm’) if you would like to drink throughout the holiday!

## Notes
I tend to skip the brandy.

Make sure to slice the orange with the peel still on.
