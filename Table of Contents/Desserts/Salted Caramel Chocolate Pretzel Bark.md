These simple, 4-ingredient **Salted Chocolate Caramel** Pretzel Bars will quickly become your new favorite sweet and salty treat!  No bake and no candy thermometer needed.

## Ingredients
- -12 ounce package semi-sweet chocolate chips, good quality chocolate divided into pieces (I like Ghiardelli best for melting)
- 8 ounces mini pretzel twists
- 11 ounce bags [Kraft Caramel Bits](https://walmrt.us/4gkWk6X) , or homemade caramel
	- can also melt 1 cup butter, 1 cup light brown sugar together (do not let boil) until caramelizes
- sea salt for sprinkling


## Directions
1. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Melt 8 ounces of the chocolate chips gently in the microwave (on low heat, stirring every 15 seconds) until smooth. 
3. Spread the chocolate evenly over the parchment. Immediately add the pretzel twists over the top (it's ok if they overlap!) and gently press them into the chocolate. 
4. Add caramel bits to a microwave safe bowl with 2 tablespoons water and melt according to package instructions (on high for 2 minutes). Stir well and drizzle the melted caramel over the top of all of the pretzels.
5. Melt remaining 4 ounces of chocolate and drizzle over the caramel. Sprinkle with sea salt.
6. Refrigerate until hardened.
7. Cut or tear into pieces, Enjoy!
