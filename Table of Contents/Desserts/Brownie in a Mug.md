## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tsp Dutch cocoa powder or additional regular
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 tbsp sugar or xylitol for sugar free
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp oil or nut butter (some readers sub applesauce or banana)
- 3 tbsp milk of choice
- 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract


## Directions
1. If baking, preheat oven to 350 F. 
2. Combine all ingredients in a mug or 1-cup dish (or two 1/2-cup dishes). 
3. Either bake around 14 minutes, OR microwave until set. 
4. Microwave times will vary depending on wattage and if using one or two dishes
	1. I cooked mine for 1 minute, followed by two 10-second increments

## Notes
*If you want to remove the brownie mug cake before eating it, be sure to grease the mug before starting. If you can’t find Dutch cocoa, subbing additional regular will still work; it will just have less of a brownie flavor. I haven’t tried subbing applesauce or banana for the fat and therefore can’t vouch for the taste of that substitution.*
