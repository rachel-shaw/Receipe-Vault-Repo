Make this pie the morning of your gathering. After it cools, pour the luscious praline topping over the crust. If your family likes to enjoy dessert after dinner settles, put the pie in the oven when you sit down to eat your meal, and serve it warm later.

## Ingredients
- 1 (15-ounce) package refrigerated piecrusts or [[Homemade Pie Dough]]
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 6 cups peeled, sliced Rome or other cooking apples
- 2 tbsp butter, cut up
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
- 2 tbsp whipping cream
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans


## Directions
1. Fit 1 piecrust into a 9-inch pie plate according to package directions.
2. Stir together sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Stir in apples; spoon mixture into crust. Dot with 2 tbsp butter; sprinkle evenly with lemon juice. Top with remaining piecrust; fold edges under, and crimp. Cut several slits in top.
3. Bake pie at 400 degrees for 45 mins on lower oven rack, shielding with aluminum foil after 30 minutes to prevent excessive browning. Remove from oven and let cool.
4. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan; stir in brown sugar and whipping cream. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly; cook 1 minute, and remove from heat. Stir in pecans, and let stand 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle mixture over pie.
