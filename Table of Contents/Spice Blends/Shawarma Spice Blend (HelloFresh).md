Shawarma spice is a bold and aromatic blend rooted in Middle Eastern cuisine, known for its warm, earthy, and slightly smoky flavor profile. It brings a balance of savory and subtly sweet notes, with a hint of spice that adds depth and richness to dishes. Ideal for marinating meats like chicken, lamb, or beef, it infuses a distinctive and mouthwatering taste, perfect for recreating the authentic flavors of shawarma wraps and platters.
