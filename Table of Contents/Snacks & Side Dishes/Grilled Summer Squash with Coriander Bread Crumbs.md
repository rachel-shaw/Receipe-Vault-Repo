# Grilled Summer Squash with Coriander Bread Crumbs

![[summersqash.jpeg]]

This dish is a flavor bomb with vinegar-saturated squash that's been nicely not-quite-burnt so its smoky bitterness balances with garlicky, citrusy coriander-scented bread crumbs. Yes, I'm obsessed with coriander. And yes, you will be too, after making this dish - it's just a magical spice that makes this incredibly simple dish a huge crowd-pleaser.

## Ingredients
- 5 medium summer squash or zucchini or a combination (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick planks
- 2 1/2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Ingredients for Bread Crumbs**
- 2 tsp whole coriander seeds
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 3/4 panko bread crumbs
- kosher salt

**Ingredients for Serving**
- grated zest of 1 lemon
- extra-virgin olive oil
- 10 small fresh basil leaves (or 3 large ones, torn)
- flaky sea salt


## Directions
**To make the squash**:
1. Preheat the grill until it’s hot. (Or preheat a large pan over medium-high heat.)
2. In a medium bowl, toss the **squash** with the **olive oil**, **vinegar**, and **kosher salt** and **pepper** to taste. Grill (or pan sear) the **squash** on both sides until lightly charred, about 5 minutes total. (It will be about 1 minute per side in a pan.)

**To make the bread crumbs:**
1. Toast the **coriander** in a dry pan until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
2. Grind the **seeds** with a mortar and pestle or in a spice grinder. 
3. Heat the **olive oil** in a medium pan over medium heat. 
4. Add the garlic and cook for just 5 seconds, making sure it doesn’t burn. 
5. Add the **bread crumbs** and season with **kosher salt**. Cook until the **bread crumbs** start to toast a bit, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the **coriander**.

**To serve:
1. Arrange the grilled **squash** on a serving plate and sprinkle the warm **bread crumbs** over the top. Finish with the **lemon zest** and a drizzle of **olive oil**, then scatter the **basil** over the top. Sprinkle with the **sea salt**.
