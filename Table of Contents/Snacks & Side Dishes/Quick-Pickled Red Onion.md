# Quick-Pickled Red Onion

![[pickledredonion.jpg]]

Used in [[Easy Chicken Shawarma in a Pita]] recipe.

I'm a huge fan of having pickles on the table, because they're the easiest way to add that necessary pop of acid that makes food taste so much better. But sometimes you don't have time to make a "proper" pickle, and that's when you reach for the quick pickle. It's a stupid-easy method you can also use for shallots and even chilis.
## Ingredients
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 2/3 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tbsp kosher salt


## Directions
1. In a medium jar, combine the onion, vinegar, sugar, salt, and 2/3 cup water. Close the lid and shake the jar very well, until the sugar and salt are dissolved. 
2. Let the pickles sit for at least 30 minutes before using. 
3. Store any leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

## Notes
From Eating Out Loud cookbook.
