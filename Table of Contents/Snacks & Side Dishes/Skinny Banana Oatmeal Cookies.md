There are multiple ways to make these. This is my interpretation of the linked recipe.

## Ingredients
- 3 overripe bananas, pureed
- 1.5-2 cups quick cooking oats
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips, mini milk chocolate
- dash of nutmeg to taste
- sprinkle of cinnamon, more than nutmeg


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Add pureed bananas and oatmeal together until forms a thicker consistency. Add in handful of chocolate chips, dash of nutmeg, and a heavy sprinkle of cinnamon to taste.
3. Spray bottom of cookie sheet. Scoop onto pan, can be close together as cookies stay the same size.
4. Bake for 15 minutes until bottoms are golden.
