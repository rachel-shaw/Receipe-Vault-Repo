These sweet, cinnamon-flavored apple bars are the perfect accompaniment for your afternoon cup of coffee or tea.

## Ingredients
- Nonstick cooking spray
- ¾ cup granulated sugar (see Tip)
- 1 ¼ cups white whole-wheat flour or all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 cups chopped apples (3 medium)
- 2 tablespoons white whole-wheat flour or all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar (see Tip)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons butter


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with foil, extending foil over the edges of the pan. Coat foil with cooking spray; set pan aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, the 1 1/4 cups white whole-wheat flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, the baking soda and salt. In another medium bowl whisk together oil, eggs and vanilla; stir in apples. Add egg mixture to flour mixture; stir until combined (batter will be very stiff and dough like). Spread batter mixture evenly in the prepared pan; if necessary, use your slightly moistened hands to pat batter into an even layer. The batter will be shallow in the pan.
3. For the topping, in a medium bowl stir together the 2 tablespoons white whole-wheat flour, the brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle crumb mixture over the batter in the baking pan.
4. Bake about 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Using the edges of the foil, lift the uncut bars out of the pan. Cut into bars.
