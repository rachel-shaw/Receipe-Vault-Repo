This strawberry bread is wonderful hot or cold, for breakfast or as a dessert. A definite family favorite!

## Ingredients
- 2 cups fresh strawberries
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 3 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1 ¼ cups chopped pecans


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
2. Slice strawberries and place in a medium-sized bowl. Sprinkle lightly with 1 tablespoon sugar and toss to coat.
3. Combine flour, 2 cups sugar, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda in large bowl; mix well.
4. Blend oil and eggs into strawberries. Add strawberry mixture to flour mixture, blending until dry ingredients are just moistened. Stir in pecans. Divide batter into pans.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes (test each loaf separately).
6. Remove from the oven and let cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn loaves out of pans, and allow to cool before slicing.
