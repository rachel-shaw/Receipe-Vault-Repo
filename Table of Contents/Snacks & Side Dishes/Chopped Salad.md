# Chopped Salad

![[choppedsalad.jpg]]

This is the most common salad you'll find on just about every menu in Israel, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But while this is a classic, I like to play around with it adding less traditional ingredients like dill or chopped radishes.
## Ingredients
- 5 medium tomatoes
- 2 red bell peppers
- 5 Persian (mini) cucumbers
- 1 small red onion
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill (optional)
- Kalamata olives (optional)
- 1/2 cup crumbled Bulgarian feta cheese (optional)
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- juice of 1 lemon
- kosher salt


## Directions
1. Finely chop the tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, and onion. As you chop, toss the vegetables into a colander to let some of their juices drain.
2. In a large bowl, combine the chopped vegetables with the parsley and dill (if using). Dress with the olive oil and lemon juice and toss thoroughly to combine. Season with salt to taste.
3. To create a greek variation, you can add the Kalamata olives and feta cheese.
