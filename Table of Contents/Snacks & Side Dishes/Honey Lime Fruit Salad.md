**Honey Lime Fruit Salad is My FAVORITE fruit salad recipe! This has been a go-to for years, and it’s never failed to be a hit. Perfect for potlucks, barbecues, family parties, weeknights, and more.**

## Ingredients
- 2 cups green grapes, halved if large
- 2 cups strawberries, quartered or sliced
- 2 cups blueberries
- 2 Tablespoons honey (use agave for vegan)
- Zest of 1 lime (about 2 teaspoons)
- Juice of 1 lime (about 2 Tablespoons)


## Directions
1. **Combine**. Add grapes, strawberries, and blueberries to a large bowl.
2. **Add Dressing**. Drizzle with honey, lime juice, and lime zest (if using).
3. **Stir gently to coat** the fruit with the dressing. Taste and add additional honey or lime juice as desired. 
4. **Serve & Store**. Enjoy right away, or store leftover fruit salad in an airtight container in the fridge up to 2-3 days. (Fruit will soften with time, so I recommend making it within about 2 hours of serving for best results.)
