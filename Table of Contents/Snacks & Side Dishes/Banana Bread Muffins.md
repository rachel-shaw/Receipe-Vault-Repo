## Ingredients
- 1 cup sugar                           
- 1/4 cup light butter, softened                              
- 1 2/3 cups mashed ripe banana (about 3 bananas)
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/4 cup low-fat plain Greek yogurt
- 2 large egg whites
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ cup oatmeal
- Cooking spray


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°.
2. Combine sugar and butter in a bowl; beat at medium speed of a mixer until well-blended. Add banana, milk, yogurt, vanilla, and egg whites; beat well, and set aside.
3. Combine flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, oatmeal and salt; stir well. Add dry ingredients to creamed mixture, beating until blended.
4. Spoon batter into 4 (5 x 2 1/2-inch) miniature loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake at 350° for 45 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool in pans 10 minutes on a wire rack; remove from pans. Let cool completely on wire racks.

## Notes
To make one 9-inch loaf, spoon batter into a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray; bake at 350º for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Yield: 1 loaf, 20 servings (serving size: 1 slice).
 
Do not use paper muffin cupcake wrappers - muffins stick.
