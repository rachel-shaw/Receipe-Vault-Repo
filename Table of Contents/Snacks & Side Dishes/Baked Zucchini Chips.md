These zucchini chips are made with thin slices of zucchini coated with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, then baked for a healthier alternative to fries or chips. Very yummy!

## Ingredients
- 3 small zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 teaspoons fresh oregano


## Directions
1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place zucchini in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil over zucchini and stir to coat; add bread crumbs and toss to coat.
3. Spread coated zucchini onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and oregano over coated zucchini.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini chips are tender and cheese is browned, about 15 minutes.
