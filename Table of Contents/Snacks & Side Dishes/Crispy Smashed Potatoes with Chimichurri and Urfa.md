These **Crispy Smashed Potatoes** with **homemade Chimichurri sauce** are seriously addicting! With soft insides, crispy crunchy edges, and a tangy chimichurri on top they make the perfect appetizer or side for any occasion!

## Ingredients
**Ingredients for Potatoes**
- kosher salt
- 3 pounds potatoes (small)
- 1/4 cup + 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- black pepper


**Ingredients for Chimichurri**
- 1/2 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 1 small garlic clove, grated
- 1 1/2 tsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil


**Ingredients for Serving**
- 1 1/2 tsp urfa pepper, cayenne pepper, or chili powder
- chopped fresh parsley
- extra-virgin olive oil
- flaky sea salt

## Directions
**Make the Potatoes:**
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes well, shaking off any excess water, and let cool slightly.
2. Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees.
3. Once the potatoes are just cool enough to handle (they will still be warm), spread them across one or two baking sheets to leave plenty of room between them. With the heel of your hand or bottom of a glass, gently smash each potato until about 1/2 inch thick. Drizzle the potatoes with the olive oil, season well with the kosher salt and black pepper, and roast until crispy and golden all over, about 25 minutes.

**Make the Chimichurri:**
1. In a food processor, combine the dill, parsley, shallot, garlic, vinegar, kosher salt, and black pepper. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped. Continuing to pulse, stream in the olive oil just until the mixture forms a loose sauce.

**To serve:**
1. Arrange the roasted potatoes on a platter and generously drizzle with the chimichurri. Sprinkle with the urfa and parsley, drizzle with olive oil, and finish with a pinch of sea salt.
