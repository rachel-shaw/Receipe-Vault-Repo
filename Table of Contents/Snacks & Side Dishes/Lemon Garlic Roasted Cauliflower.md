A little lemon, garlic, and fresh parsley give this roasted cauliflower an excellent flavor. The recipe is easy, and it's a nice side dish alternative to potatoes or rice. Serve it for a family dinner alongside chicken or pork, or a vegetarian main like [mushroom bean burgers](https://www.thespruceeats.com/vegan-mushroom-bean-burger-recipe-3378623) for a tasty meal.

## Ingredients
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets, about 5 to 6 cups
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from 1 large lemon
- 1 teaspoon crushed and minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- Grated Parmesan cheese, optional


## Directions
1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan with foil.
3. Cut the cauliflower into florets (you should have about 5 to 6 cups).
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the olive oil with the lemon juice, garlic, salt, black pepper, and parsley. Add the cauliflower florets and toss to coat thoroughly.
5. Spread the florets in the prepared baking pan.
2. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender and browned, turning about halfway through the cooking time.
3. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, if desired.

## Notes
For faster roasting, cut the head of cauliflower into 1/2-inch flat slices.

Can also substitute broccoli.

Serves 4.
