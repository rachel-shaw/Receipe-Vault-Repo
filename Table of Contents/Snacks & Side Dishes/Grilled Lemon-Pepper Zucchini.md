I like to serve this easy summer-vegetable dish with grilled chicken and rice. I suppose you could switch the type of seasonings you use if you'd like a different flavor, or even change up the vegetables to suit your liking.

## Ingredients
- 2 small yellow squash, sliced
- 2 small zucchini, sliced
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, minced
- 1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning


## Directions
1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. When hot, lightly oil grate.
2. Combine the squash, zucchini, onion, and bell pepper in a bowl; drizzle with olive oil; sprinkle with lemon-pepper seasoning; stir to coat. Place the vegetable mixture in the center of a large sheet of aluminum foil. Top with another large sheet of aluminum foil. Roll the edges of the foil sheets together to seal into a packet.
3. Place the packet on the preheated grill. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes, turning the packet every 5 to 10 minutes.

## Notes
Serves 4.
