This is a very traditional beef jerky recipe which calls for some pretty common but TASTY ingredients. Most of the ingredients you will already have in your pantry, so no need to break the bank at the grocery store. Simply add all the ingredients into a bowl or ziplock bag and mix until they are well incorporated together. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6-24 hours mixing the bag up several times to further make sure the strips are evenly coated. This makes sure the every piece of finished beef jerky has a consistent flavor.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb Beef Eye of Round or Venison
- 1 ½ teaspoon pickling salt (or sea salt)
- 1 ½ teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon coriander (ground)
- ½ cup cold water
- ¼ teaspoon [Prague Powder #1](http://amzn.to/2yhiA00) (curing salt)
- ½ teaspoon [liquid smoke](https://amzn.to/2DffviN) (mesquite)


## Directions
1. Trim all visible fat from the beef and place in freezer for an hour or two to partially freeze.
2. While the meat is in the freezer, combine the pickling salt, [curing salt](http://amzn.to/2yhiA00), coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, liquid smoke, black pepper, sugar, and cold water in a medium size bowl or ziplock bag. Mix well.
3. Remove the meat from the freezer and slice ¼" strips with the grain. Or skip the freezing phase and use a [jerky slicer](http://amzn.to/2ki16uM) for evenly sliced strips.
4. Tenderize the beef strips with a tenderizing mallet to prevent the jerky from being too tough.
5. Add sliced beef to the mixture and marinate for 6-24 hours in the refrigerator.
6. After the meat has finished marinating, remove from refrigerator and pat dry with paper towels.
7. A [Dehydrator](http://amzn.to/2yfHwFw) was used with this recipe and dried for 7 hours at 160 degrees. You can also use a [smoker](https://www.jerkyholic.com/make-beef-jerky-smoker/) or your [oven](https://www.jerkyholic.com/how-to-make-beef-jerky-in-the-oven/).

## Notes
- Leaving the curing salt out of the recipe will alter the look and flavor of this recipe
- Use liquid smoke that does not include filler ingredients, such as [Wright's Liquid Smoke](https://amzn.to/2DffviN)
- When finished, jerky will bend and crack but not break in half. Test for doneness after a piece has cooled for 5 minutes, not while warm.
- Store in ziplock bags or vacuum seal for longer storage.
