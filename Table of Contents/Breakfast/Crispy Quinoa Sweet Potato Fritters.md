I know I should eat more vegetables, but I’m often not in the mood to crunch on raw carrot sticks and greens. Thankfully, I found an easy workaround: veggie-packed Sweet Potato Fritters!

Loaded with fiber, complex carbs, healthy fats, and protein, these crispy fritters are ideal for keeping you satiated and nourished. They’re also portable, kid-friendly, and ideal for snacking, breakfast (or brunch), bowl meals, and beyond!

## Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked + cooled quinoa
- 2 cups shredded sweet potato (no need to peel)
- 2 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil, plus more for cooking
- 1/2 cup diced red or white onion (or sub shallot)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 healthy pinch each sea salt and black pepper
- 2 cups chopped greens (we prefer spinach)
- 3 medium eggs, whisked* 
- 1/2 tsp sea salt, plus more to taste
- 1 tsp curry powder (_**optional**_)
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- Sauce for serving (such as [coconut yogurt](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-2-ingredient-coconut-yogurt/), [hummus](https://minimalistbaker.com/best-ever-5-minute-microwave-hummus/), or [garlic dill sauce](https://minimalistbaker.com/4-ingredient-garlic-dill-sauce/))
- Fresh herbs (mint, cilantro, parsley)


## Directions
1. If you do not already have cooked quinoa, prepare it at this time. 2/3 cup uncooked quinoa will yield ~2 cups cooked.
2. Shred sweet potato using either the coarse side of a box grater or the grater attachment of a food processor.
3. Heat a large pot or rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, sweet potato, garlic, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the onion and sweet potato are tender and fragrant. Add chopped greens and stir to slightly wilt. Set aside.
4. Add eggs to a medium mixing bowl and whisk until well combined. (**NOTE**: Depending on the size of your eggs, you may need less as some readers reported having success with 1 less egg!). Set aside.
5. To a large mixing bowl add sautéed vegetables, cooked and cooled quinoa, salt, and curry powder (optional) and stir. Then add eggs and stir. Lastly, add gluten-free flour and stir until combined. You should have a slightly tacky but moldable mixture. Add more gluten-free flour as needed if too wet to handle.
6. Form into thin (roughly 1/4-inch-thick) patties the size of the palm of your hand. In the meantime, heat a large rimmed skillet (we prefer cast iron).
7. Once hot, add a little oil to coat the pan and enough fritters to comfortably fit without crowding. Pan fry until golden brown — ~ 4 minutes on each side.
	- _Optional_: For even crispier fritters, continue baking in a 400 degree F (204 C) oven for 10-15 minutes.
8. Serve hot with garnishes of choice, such as lemon juice, [dairy-free yogurt](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-2-ingredient-coconut-yogurt/), [hummus](https://minimalistbaker.com/best-ever-5-minute-microwave-hummus/), [garlic dill sauce](https://minimalistbaker.com/4-ingredient-garlic-dill-sauce/), or fresh herbs (all optional).
