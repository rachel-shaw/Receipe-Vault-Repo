My son loves this recipe even though he doesn't care much for breakfast food.

## Ingredients
- 4 slices bacon
- 2 peeled and diced potatoes
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic salt
- ⅛ teaspoon seasoning salt
- ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
- 3 eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese


## Directions
1. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon slices, reserving grease. Crumble bacon and set aside.
2. Add potatoes to bacon grease and season with garlic salt, seasoned salt and black pepper. Cook until potatoes are soft.
3. When potatoes are tender, add crumbled bacon. Pour eggs over potatoes and cook until firm. Spread with cheese and cover with lid until melted.

## Notes
Serves 2.
