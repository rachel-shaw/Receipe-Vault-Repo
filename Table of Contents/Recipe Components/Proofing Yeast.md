This is to <u>proof</u> yeast; you will use subtract the amount of sugar, water, and yeast used from the recipe.
## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 packet Instant Red Star Platinum yeast (2 1/4 tsp) 
- 1/2 cup water (or milk depending on recipe you are proofing yeast for; can also change this amount based on recipe)


## Directions
1. Warm water to approximately 100 degrees. We recommend testing the water temperature using a thermometer. Once you've done this a few times, you'll get a natural feel for how warm the water should be without being too hot to kill the yeast culture.
2. Whisk the sugar into the water to help it dissolve. Why sugar? Yeast eats various sugars and excretes alcohol and carbon dioxide. Alcohol and carbon dioxide are what the pockets in bread are filled with as bread bakes. In other words, sugar makes a feast for the yeast.
3. Once the sugar has been evenly distributed throughout the water, add the yeast. Stir gently and let it sit.
4. After 5 or 10 minutes, the yeast should begin to form a creamy foam on the surface of the water. That foam means the yeast is alive. You can now proceed to combine the yeast mixture with the flour and other dry ingredients in your recipe. If there is no foam, the yeast is dead and you should start over with a new packet of yeast.

## Notes
Denise used 1/2 to 1 tsp of sugar and lets it sit for 5 minutes. She also recommends testing water temp with clean finger.
