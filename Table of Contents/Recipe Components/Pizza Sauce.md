A quick, well rounded pantry pizza sauce that comes together in a couple stirs. For minimal clean-up, use a tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon for measuring, doubling and halving when needed.

## Ingredients
- 4 tbsp. tomato paste
- 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 1 small clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp. dried basil
- 1/4 tsp. dried thyme
- 1/8 tsp. kosher salt
- 4+ tbsp. water


## Directions
1. Stir together all the sauce ingredients in a bowl or mason jar until smooth. Add additional water 1 tablespoon at a time to thin to desired consistency. I prefer my sauce on the thinner side. Taste and add additional salt if needed. This sauce is strong in flavor. A little goes a long way, so spread a very thin layer on your pie.
2. This can be made up to a week in advance. Store leftovers in an airtight jar.

## Notes
Pair with [[Wood Fire Pizza Dough]] recipe.
