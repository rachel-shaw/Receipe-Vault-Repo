Sofrito is a basic preparation in Mediterranean, Latin American, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese cooking. It typically consists of aromatic ingredients cut into small pieces and sautéed or braised in cooking oil for a long period of time over a low heat.

In modern Spanish cuisine, _sofrito_ consists of garlic, onion, and peppers cooked in olive oil, and optionally tomatoes or carrots. This is known as _refogado, sufrito_, or sometimes as _estrugido_ in Portuguese-speaking nations, where only garlic, onions, and olive oil are considered essential, tomato and bay laurel leaves being the other most common ingredients.

## Ingredients
- garlic cloves
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- oil to taste


## Directions
1. Add ingredients to small saucepan over medium high heat. Season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have released their liquid and are beginning to brown lightly on the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes.
