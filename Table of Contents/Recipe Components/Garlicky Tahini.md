Used in [[Easy Chicken Shawarma in a Pita]] recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 cup tahini paste (recommend [Soom Foods](https://amzn.to/4cdBxzS) organic tahini or [[Homemade Tahini]])
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 cup ice water, plus more if needed


## Directions
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and ice water. It will reach a weird, lumpy consistency, but don’t be afraid. Keep whisking until it smooths out and becomes light in color (if it doesn’t, it needs more ice water, so just add a bit more). Tahini sauce with the perfect consistency will drip through the tines of a fork, but just barely. 
2. Taste for seasoning, adding more lemon juice or salt if desired. 
3. Store in a jar in the fridge for up to 1 week. If the tahini gets too thick while in the fridge, just loosen it up with a little water before using.

## Notes
From the Eating Out Loud cookbook. 

Makes 2 cups.
