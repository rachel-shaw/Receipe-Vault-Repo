Pâte brisée is the French version of classic pie or tart pastry. It's a versatile all-butter dough we use for both sweet and savory recipes—everything from apple pie to quiche. Our pâte brisée is made with just all-purpose flour, unsalted butter, salt, a little sugar, and water. (Omit the sugar if you prefer.) The dough comes quickly together in the food processor, then chills for an hour or more in the refrigerator before using it for your favorite pie or tart recipes. (Don't skip the chilling! The pâte brisée will be much easier to roll out when it has rested, the gluten has relaxed, and the butter firmed up.)

## Ingredients
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water


## Directions
1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Add butter, and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, 8 to 10 seconds.
2. With machine running, add ice water in a slow, steady stream through feed tube. Pulse until dough holds together without being wet or sticky; be careful not to process more than 30 seconds. To test, squeeze a small amount together: If it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
3. Divide dough into two equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disc and wrap in plastic. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill at least 1 hour.

## Notes
The pâte brisée dough can also be frozen for up to three months. Let it defrost overnight in the refrigerator before using.

Recipe from Denise (Martha Stewart printout)

- What is pâte brisée called in English?
In English, there are several names for pâte brisée. In the U.K., this pastry is called shortcrust pastry, a nod to its short or crumbly texture. In the U.S., it is generally called pie pastry or pie dough because it is most often used for pies.  

- What's the difference between puff pastry and pâte brisée?
The main difference between puff pastry and pâte brisée is their texture. Both types of pastry are made with flour and butter, but the proportion of butter is higher in puff pastry and the technique for making it is different. Puff pastry is made by folding butter between layers of dough, turning, rolling, and repeating to create a flaky pastry with layers. It's more complex than making pâte brisée which is easy to make. Pâte brisée has a more crumbly texture than puff pastry which bakes into flaky layers.

- What if pâte brisée is too crumbly?
If the pâte brisée is too crumbly it won't hold together. In our recipe, we call for testing it as you mix it in the food processor. Squeezing a small amount together between your fingers and if it is too crumbly to hold together, adding more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
