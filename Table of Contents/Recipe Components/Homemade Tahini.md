![[Tahini-Recipe.jpg]]

Making tahini at home is easy and cheaper than buying it from the store. I also think it tastes better! For the best deals, look for sesame seeds in bulk bins or at International, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup (140g) sesame seeds, we prefer hulled
- 2 to 4 tablespoons neutral flavored oil such as avocado,  grape seed, vegetable or a light olive oil
- Pinch of salt (optional)


## Directions
1. Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly, until the seeds become fragrant and turn light golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stay close and keep stirring, as the seeds can burn quickly.
2. Add the toasted sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor, then process until a crumbly paste, about 1 minute.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple of times.
4. Check the tahini’s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty, and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute and add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil.
5. Taste the tahini for seasoning, then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix.
6. Store tahini in an airtight container in the fridge for one month.

## Notes
- Tahini made from unhulled sesame seeds tastes more bitter and isn’t as smooth as when made from hulled seeds. I recommend using hulled seeds.
- The sesame seeds take a minute or two to start breaking down (watch our video for reference). If your seeds are whirling around your processor bowl, you may need a higher-powered processor, or the blade may be sitting above the seeds. If you think this is the case, try increasing the sesame seeds in the bowl.

Makes approximately 1/2 cup.
