You’ve heard of farm to table? This is “pan to table!” There’s nothing easier or more satisfying on a weeknight than digging into a bountiful skillet. This one features tender zucchini, savory turkey, and caramelized onion, infused with aromatic spices, and topped with a creamy lemon-garlic sauce and juicy marinated tomatoes. Best of all, it’s ready in just 30 minutes!

## Ingredients
- 1.5 cup jasmine rice
- 2 zucchini
- 2 yellow onions
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 2 lemons
- 4 garlic cloves
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 6 tbsp sour cream
- 20 ounce ground turkey
- 2 tbsp [[Tunisian Spice Blend]]
- 4 tsp chicken stock concentrate


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. In a small pot, combine rice, 2¼ cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat (you’ll use it in Step 5). • Zest and quarter lemon. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Dice tomato. Trim and quarter zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Halve, peel, and finely dice onion.
2. In a small bowl, combine lemon zest, mayonnaise, sour cream, half the garlic, juice from half a lemon, and a pinch of salt. In a separate small bowl, combine tomato, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Remove pan from heat; transfer zucchini to a plate. Wipe out pan and let cool for 1 minute.
4. Heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add turkey and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until lightly browned, 1-3 minutes. Add onion, Tunisian Spice Blend, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until onion is browned and turkey is cooked through, 3-4 minutes more.
5. Stir remaining garlic into pan with turkey; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. • Stir in rice, zucchini, stock concentrates, and ½ cup water. Cook, stirring, until thoroughly combined and water is absorbed, 1-3 minutes. Cook, undisturbed, until crust forms on bottom of pan, 1-2 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
6. Top skillet with marinated tomato; drizzle with sauce. Serve directly from pan with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
