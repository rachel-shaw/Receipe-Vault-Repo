We love a good ground-beef taco, but you don’t need us to tell you how to make one—there are kits for that. Instead, we’re here to show you how to take Tex-Mex night to the next level. So enter the tostada, featuring a flat tortilla baked until crisp, with lots of surface area for piling it on. Thankfully, there are plenty of toppings in this recipe, and not just warmly spiced ground beef—there’s also green pepper, tomato salsa, and a spicy sour cream.

## Ingredients
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 1/2 ounce cilantro
- 2 limes
- 2 long green peppers
- 1 yellow onion
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 2 tsp beef stock concentrate
- 12 flour tortillas
- 1 cup Mexican cheese blend


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice tomato. Roughly chop cilantro. Halve and peel onion; thinly slice one half. Finely chop remaining onion until you have 2 TBSP. Quarter lime. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper into strips.
2. In a medium bowl, combine tomato, cilantro, chopped onion, juice from half the lime, and a pinch of salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and as much hot sauce as you like. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.
3. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add beef, Southwest Spice, chili powder, and a few big pinches of salt. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 4-5 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in the next step).
4. Once beef is browned, add green pepper, sliced onion, and a pinch of salt to pan. Cook, stirring, until veggies are tender and beef is cooked through, 5-7 minutes. Add stock concentrate and ½ cup water. Simmer until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt; remove pan from heat and set aside.
5. Drizzle tortillas with 2 TBSP olive oil; brush or rub to coat all over. Divide between 2 sheets in a single layer. Gently prick each tortilla in a few places with a fork. Bake on top and middle racks, flipping halfway through, until lightly golden, 4-5 minutes per side - swap rack positions halfway through baking. TIP: Watch carefully — tortillas brown fast!
6. Divide tortillas between plates; evenly sprinkle with Mexican cheese. Top with beef mixture, salsa, and crema. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
