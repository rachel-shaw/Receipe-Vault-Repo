Think a cheesy stuffed pasta can’t get any better? What about baking said pasta in a creamy sauce and with a crispy topping? This dish checks ALL those boxes—and we’re obsessed. Here, we toss tender, cheese-stuffed tortelloni in an herby tomato cream sauce, then finish with a layer of Parmesan and panko breadcrumbs. Once broiled, it turns golden and crunchy, making a showstopping topping that’s guaranteed to earn you plenty of oohs and aahs from your lucky fellow diners.

## Ingredients
- 4 garlic cloves
- 4 roma tomatoes
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 2 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 2 tsp mushroom stock concentrate
- 8 tbsp cream cheese
- 3 ounce tomato paste
- 18 ounce cheese tortelloni
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Heat broiler to high. Wash and dry produce. • Peel and mince garlic. Dice tomatoes. • In a small bowl, combine panko, Parmesan, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic, Italian Seasoning, and a pinch of chili flakes to taste; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 1-2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in 1½ cup water, stock concentrate, and cream cheese. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until fully combined. Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Add tortelloni to pan; cook, stirring, until sauce is thickened and tortelloni are tender, 4-6 minutes. (TIP: If sauce is too thick before tortelloni are tender, add a splash more water.) Turn off heat. Stir in 3 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper. If sauce seems too thick, add a splash of water. TIP: If pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer mixture now to a baking dish.
4. Evenly sprinkle tortelloni with panko mixture. Broil until panko is golden brown, 2-4 minutes. (TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning.) Garnish with more chili flakes if desired. Divide between plates and serve.
