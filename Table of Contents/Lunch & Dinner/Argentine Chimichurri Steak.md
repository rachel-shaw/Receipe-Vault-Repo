Argentinians love their beef—their asados (barbecues) are practically celebrations of the meat. Head to one and you’ll likely find a nicely seared steak accompanied by a communal bowl of chimichurri—a drizzly herb sauce with a pinch of tartness and heat. Although we can’t send you the experience of dining al fresco in picturesque Patagonia, we can give you this recipe that, along with a roasted veggie jumble, recreates those incredible flavors.

## Ingredients
- 4 sweet potatoes
- 2 shallots
- 1 jalapeno
- 1/2 ounce cilantro
- 2 limes
- 8 ounce grape tomatoes
- 2 poblano pepper
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp cumin
- 24 ounce sirloin steak


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Peel sweet potatoes, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Peel and halve shallot. Cut halves into quarters. Mince jalapeño (removing ribs and seeds for less heat. Finely chop cilantro. Halve lime and tomatoes. Core and seed poblano, then cut into ½-inch squares. Mince garlic.
2. Toss sweet potatoes, poblano, and shallot on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in oven until browned and slightly crispy, 20-25 minutes, tossing halfway through.
3. Set aside 1 TBSP cilantro for salad. Combine remaining cilantro, ½ tsp cumin, 3 TBSP olive oil, a pinch of garlic, jalapeño (to taste), and a squeeze of lime in a small bowl. Season generously with salt, pepper, and more garlic, cumin, and lime (to taste).
4. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Season steak all over with salt and pepper. Add to pan and cook to desired doneness, 3-6 minutes per side. Remove from pan and let rest 5 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain.
5. In a medium bowl, toss sweet potatoes, poblanos, shallot, tomatoes, reserved cilantro, a squeeze of lime, and any remaining jalapeño (to taste). Season with salt and pepper.
6. Divide salad and steak between plates. Serve with chimichurri for drizzling.
