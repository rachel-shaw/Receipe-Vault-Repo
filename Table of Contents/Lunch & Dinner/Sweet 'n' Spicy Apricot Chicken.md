“This meal is my JAM!” is what we’re pretty sure you’ll be saying after just one bite of these savory-sweet chicken. Apricot jam blends with umami-rich ponzu and spicy Sriracha to make a tangy pan sauce with just enough heat to fire on all cylinders. You’ll serve it with chili-roasted carrots and garlicky roasted broccoli. Flavorful, unique, memorable—this meal’s about to get totally stuck in your head.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce carrots
- 2 tsp korean chili flakes
- 16 ounce broccoli florets
- 4 scallions
- 20 ounce chicken cutlets
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tbsp apricot jam
- 24 mL Ponzu sauce
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1.  Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1⁄2-inch-thick pieces (if carrots are on the larger side, halve lengthwise first). • Toss carrots on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, chili flakes (use less if you prefer less heat), and salt. Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add more to the sheet then).
2. Cut broccoli into bite-sized pieces if necessary. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
3. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer to a cutting board to rest and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe out pan.
4. Once carrots have roasted for 5 minutes, carefully toss broccoli on opposite side of sheet with a drizzle of oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. • Return to top rack until veggies are browned and tender, 15-20 minutes more.
5. Once veggies are almost done roasting, heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for chicken over medium heat. Add scallion whites; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. • Add jam, ponzu, Sriracha, and 1⁄3 cup water to pan. Cook, stirring, until thickened, 1-3 minutes. TIP: If sauce seems too thick, stir in more water 1 tsp at a time. • Remove from heat and stir in 2 TBSP butter until melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Slice chicken crosswise. • Divide chicken and veggies between plates. Spoon sauce over chicken and garnish with scallion greens. Serve.
