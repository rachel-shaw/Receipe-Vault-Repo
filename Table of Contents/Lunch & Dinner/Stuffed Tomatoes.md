These stuffed tomatoes are filled with a cheesy, spicy tomato, sausage, and bread crumb filling for a tasty side dish.

## Ingredients
- 2 large ripe tomatoes
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, partially drained
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- ⅔ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- ¼ pound smoked sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Cut the tops off tomatoes and use a knife to cut around the inside, separating the flesh from the skin. Scoop out flesh. Place tomatoes in a small baking dish.
3. Combine canned tomatoes with bread crumbs, and 1/3 cup of cheese in a small bowl. Stir in sausage; mix well. Spoon the mixture into tomato skins and top with remaining 1/3 cup of cheese.
4. Bake in preheated oven until tomatoes are warmed through and cheese has melted, about 15 minutes.

## Notes
Serves 2.
