Why have an average-sized bite of cheesy stuffed pasta, when you could have that same bite slightly bigger? Our chefs wondered the same thing, which is why this dinner features tortelloni (the jumbo cousin of tortellini) coated with a garlicky-herb butter sauce, and topped with roasted tomatoes and zucchini. Toasty panko and Parmesan finish the dish for a flavorful, filling dinner in around 30 minutes. Thanks to tortelloni, you can go big and stay home!

## Ingredients
- 2 zucchini
- 4 tomatoes
- 2 shallots
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 18 ounce cheese tortelloni
- 6 tbsp parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 5 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick half-moons. Halve tomatoes; cut into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot. Mince garlic.
2. Toss zucchini and tomatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast until browned and tender, 15-20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, place 4 TBSP butter in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until just softened, 10 seconds. • Stir in garlic, 2 tsp Italian Seasoning, 1 tsp salt, and a pinch of chili flakes.
4. Melt 1 TBSP plain butter in a small pan over medium-high heat. Add panko and cook, stirring, until golden and toasted, 2-3 minutes. • Turn off heat; season with salt and pepper. • Once water is boiling, add tortelloni to pot. Cook until al dente, 3-4 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
5. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in pot used for tortelloni over medium-high heat. Add shallot; cook, stirring, until softened, 1-2 minutes. Add garlic herb butter; cook until melted, 30-60 seconds. • Stir in 1⁄3 cup reserved pasta cooking water. Add cooked tortelloni; stir to coat. If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until tortelloni is thoroughly coated in sauce. • Turn off heat; season with salt and pepper.
6. Divide tortelloni between bowls. Top with roasted veggies. Sprinkle with Parmesan, toasted panko to taste, and a pinch of remaining chili flakes if desired. Serve.
