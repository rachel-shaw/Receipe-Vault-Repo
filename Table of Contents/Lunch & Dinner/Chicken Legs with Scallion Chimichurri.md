When it comes to chicken, we’re always looking for two things: gorgeous, crackly skin and juicy, flavorful meat. You too? Enter: these pan-seared chicken legs. To make things even more delicious, they’re drizzled with a bright and tangy scallion chimichurri, which perfectly balances the meat’s richness. It’s all sitting atop a bed of fluffy rice, alongside creamy black beans and a cooling lime crema. Sound too good to be true? It’s not! This delicious dish all comes together in 40 minutes. What are you waiting for?!

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 2 limes
- 26.8 ounce black beans
- 32 ounce chicken legs
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Wash and dry all produce. Trim and roughly chop scallions. Peel and mince garlic. Dice tomato. Zest 1 lime and quarter both limes. Drain and rinse beans.
2. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Drizzle with oil; season all over with salt, pepper, and half the Southwest Spice (you’ll use the rest later). Place skin sides up on prepared baking sheet. Roast until browned and cooked through, 28-32 minutes. TIP: If chicken skin isn’t yet crispy, broil for 2-3 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a small pot, combine rice, 1½ cup water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
4. While rice cooks, in a small bowl, combine scallions, 3 TBSP olive oil, juice from 2 lime wedge, and a pinch of garlic to taste. Season generously with salt and pepper. Taste and add more garlic or lime juice if you feel like something is missing.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add tomato and remaining garlic. Cook until softened, 1-2 minutes. Add beans, stock concentrate, ⅓ cup water, salt, pepper, and remaining Southwest Spice. Simmer until thickened, 5-10 minutes. Turn off heat; stir in 2 TBSP butter. 
6. In a second small bowl, combine sour cream, half the lime zest, juice from 2 lime wedge, and salt. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
7. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 2 TBSP butter, remaining lime zest, and juice from any remaining lime wedges to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice and chicken between plates. Top rice with bean mixture and lime crema. Drizzle chicken with chimichurri and serve.
