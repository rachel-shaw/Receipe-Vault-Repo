Tender ravioli are pretty much good in any form, but they’re especially great when packed with fresh spinach and creamy ricotta. This rendition is “dragged through the garden,” majorly amping up the veggie factor. Yep, this delicious dish is loaded with chopped and ribboned zucchini, diced tomato, and a bevvy of Italian herbs and spices. It’s taken to the next level with a creamy lemon sauce, nutty Parmesan, and a sprinkle of scallion greens. Be still, our pasta-loving hearts…

## Ingredients
- 2 zucchini
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 2 scallions
- 1 lemon
- 18 ounce spinach and ricotta ravioli
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 18 ounce chicken sausage
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Trim ends from zucchini; shave zucchini lengthwise into thin ribbons using a peeler, rotating as you go, until you get to the seedy core. Finely chop core. Dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lemon.
2. Once water is boiling, gently add ravioli to pot. Immediately reduce to a low simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente and floating to the top, 4-5 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain. TIP: Gently shake strainer with ravioli in it to remove as much moisture as possible.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate; use pan in next step.
4. Meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chopped zucchini, tomato, scallion whites, and 2 tsp Italian Seasoning. Cook until veggies are just softened, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Reduce heat under pan with veggies to medium, then stir in stock concentrate, 1⁄3 cup reserved pasta cooking water, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Reduce heat to low and cook, 1-2 minutes. Stir in sour cream and 2 TBSP butter until melted and combined. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved cooking water a splash at a time until sauce reaches a creamy consistency.
6. Separate zucchini ribbons with your hands, then stir into pan with sauce. Gently stir in drained ravioli. Simmer until sauce has thickened, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon zest to taste.
7. Stir in sausage with ravioli.
8. Divide pasta between bowls. Garnish with scallion greens and Parmesan. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.

## Notes
Can also make vegetarian but removing chicken sausage; the remaining ingredients stay the same.
Serves 4.
