## Ingredients
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup flour
- seasoning salt
- salt
- pepper
- crisco to oil electric skillet (do not use butter - it burns)
- 1 stick of butter
- milk
- potatoes
- chicken breast


## Directions
1. In one saucer, combine egg and milk. Scramble with fork.
2. In another saucer, combine 1/2 flour with seasoning salt, salt, and pepper.
3. Dunk chicken in egg mix, and then flour mix. Shake off excess but not too much.
4. Turn the electric skillet on high to preheat. The hotter it is, the more crispys there will be. 
5. Once the skillet is preheated, turn it down slightly. Add crisco and chicken.
6. To make the gravy, leave the crispys in the skillet. Add a stick of butter and let it melt. Sprinkle flour. You want it to be clumpy with no extra flour.
7. Pour in a little milk. Whisk it in. Add salt and pepper. Done when bubbling.
8. Make the mashed potatoes in a medium pot fill of water. Start on low heat and then bring to a boil. Add salt, pepper, milk, and butter in bowl. Mash potatoes into bowl when done.
