This crispy potato hash has it all: caramelized onion, smoky poblano pepper, and sweet corn. But the BEST part is the creamy chipotle sauce. Top it all with a drizzle of tangy sour cream for a perfect balance to the dish’s subtle spice.

## Ingredients
- 2 corn on the cobs
- 2 poblano peppers
- 24 ounces russet potatoes
- 2 yellow onions
- 24 ounces sirloin steak
- 3.5 ounce chipotles in Adobo
- 2 tsp beef stock concentrate
- 4 tbsp sour cream


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. reheat the oven to 450 degrees. Halve, peel, and thinly slice half the onion. Finely dice the remaining half. Core, seed, and thinly slice the poblano pepper. Cut the corn kernels off the cob. Peel and chop the potato into ½-inch cubes.
2. Toss the potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place in the oven for 20-25 minutes, tossing once, until golden brown and crispy.
3. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and poblano pepper to the pan and cook, tossing, for 6-7 minutes, until slightly caramelized. Add the corn to the pan and cook, tossing, for another 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside in a large bowl, covered, to keep warm.
4. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in the same pan over high heat. Season the steak on all sides with salt and pepper. Sear the steak 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown. Place the steak onto the baking sheet with the potatoes. Return to the oven for 4-8 minutes, until cooked to desired doneness. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
5. Make the sauce: Add the diced onion and a drizzle of olive oil to the same pan you cooked the steak in over medium heat. Cook, tossing, for 2-3 minutes, until softened. Removing the sauce from around the pepper, add ¼ teaspoon adobo sauce to the pan (you can always add more later!). Cook 30 seconds. Stir in ½ cup water and the beef stock concentrate, and simmer until reduced by half. Remove from heat, and stir in the sour cream. Taste before adding more adobo sauce, if desired.
6. Finish: Toss the potatoes into the bowl with the veggie hash. Thinly slice the steak against the grain. Plate the hash, then top with the sliced steak and creamy chipotle sauce. Enjoy!
