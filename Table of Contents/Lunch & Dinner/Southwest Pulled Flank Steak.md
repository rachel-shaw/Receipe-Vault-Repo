Use a slow cooker for this recipe. Start with spraying with oil and put the flank steak in it. Add the rest of the ingredients and give it a quick stir. Cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 6 to 8 hours. You can use any pressure cooker, instant pot or a dutch oven. Dutch oven pulled flank steak will take much less time, about 2 to 3 hours on low heat.

When you see it’s almost cooked, about 80% complete, then pull apart the meat, and leave it to cook completely in its own juices.

Take your cooked and shredded beef and season with salt and pepper. Garnish the pulled flank steak with some fresh lime and cilantro.

Enjoy it warm, or even cold the next day in a lunch burrito or with side rice as ropa vieja.

## Ingredients
- 2 lb raw lean flank, beef or buffalo
- 1/3 cup red onion, chopped
- 1/2 tablespoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 2 heaping tablespoons tomato paste
- pinch of sea salt & pepper
- 1/3 cup water
- fresh lime, garnish
- fresh chopped cilantro, garnish


## Directions
1. Spray the slow cooker with olive oil, then add the flank steak. For best results, it’s best if the flank steak is not rolled – try as much as possible to lay it flat. Add the rest of the ingredients, give it a quick stir, then cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 6 to 8 hours. Alternatively, you can also use a dutch oven and cook for about 2 to 3 hours on low heat.
2. When the meat is about 85% complete with the cooking cycle, gently pull it apart with forks, then allow it to cook for the remaining time in it’s own juices.
3. Season to taste with sea salt, pepper, fresh lime and cilantro
4. Enjoy this warm, or even cold the next day in a lunch burrito!
