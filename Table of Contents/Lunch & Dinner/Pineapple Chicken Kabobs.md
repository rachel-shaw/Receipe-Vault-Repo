Delicious little bites for an appetizer or a light meal with a salad!

## Ingredients
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ⅓ cup light soy sauce
- 2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins or strips
- skewers
- pineapples, diced

## Directions
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix pineapple juice, brown sugar, and soy sauce. Remove from heat just before the mixture comes to a boil.
2. Place chicken tenders in a medium bowl. Cover with the pineapple marinade, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
3. Preheat grill for medium heat. Thread chicken lengthwise onto wooden skewers, alternating with pineapple and red bell peppers.
4. Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken tenders 5 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. They cook quickly, so watch them closely.
