Red and yellow peppers, orange sweet potatoes, scallion greens, and lime—okay, so we might be missing the BIV part of ROYGBIV, but the first four letters are well-represented on this plate. The bright and colorful veggie jumble is bursting with concentrated oven-roasted flavors, while the spice-rubbed chicken breasts on top bring Southwestern flair.

## Ingredients
- 4 sweet potatoes
- 4 bell peppers
- 4 scallions
- 2 limes
- 2 tsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 24 ounces chicken breasts
- 1 cup feta cheese


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Adjust rack to upper position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Peel sweet potatoes, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in oven until tender, about 25 minutes total (we’ll be adding more items to the sheet after 10 minutes).
2. Core and seed bell peppers, then cut into 1-inch squares. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Zest lime into a medium bowl, then cut into halves.
3. Add 1 tsp Southwest spice blend and a large drizzle of olive oil to bowl with lime zest and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Pat chicken dry with a paper towel, then add to bowl and rub spice mixture into meat. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in center, 5-6 minutes per side.
4. Once sweet potatoes have roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Give sweet potatoes a toss and push toward one side of sheet. Add bell peppers to other side of sheet. Return sheet to oven and roast until both are tender, 12-15 minutes more.
5. Once sweet potatoes and bell peppers are done, add to another medium bowl along with scallion whites, feta cheese, and a squeeze of lime. Season with salt, pepper, and more lime (to taste).
6. Thinly slice chicken. Divide jumble between plates, then top with chicken. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.
