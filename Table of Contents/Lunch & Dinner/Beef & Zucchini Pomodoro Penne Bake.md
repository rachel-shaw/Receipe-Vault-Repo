No matter the weather, it’s pretty much impossible not to daydream about cheesy baked carbs. Luckily, this dish is guaranteed to make those dreams come true. In it, you’ll find penne and zucchini layered with herby, creamy ricotta and a rich marinara sauce. To top things off, there’s a melty blanket of mozzarella. Serve it right from the dish for maximum cheese pull potential and wait for the oohs and aahs from your lucky fellow diners.

## Ingredients
- 2 zucchini
- 1 onion
- 2 tomatoes
- 12 ounce penne pasta
- 28 ounce marinara sauce
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 8 ounce ricotta cheese
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Halve, peel, and dice onion. Finely dice tomato. Trim zucchini, then grate on the largest holes of a box grater.
2. Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until almost al dente, 8 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in step 6). • Drain penne. (Keep empty pot handy for step 5.)
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add beef or sausage; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wipe out pan.
4. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add diced onion, tomato, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in marinara, zucchini, 1 tsp Italian Seasoning, ½ cup water, 2 tsp sugar, and a big pinch of salt. (You’ll use more Italian Seasoning in the next step.) Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring, 3 minutes more. Turn off heat.
5. Use pan used for beef or sausage here. Once sauce is done, return beef or sausage to pan; stir to combine.
6. While sauce simmers, in a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1 tsp Italian Seasoning, and a drizzle of olive oil. (Use the rest of the Italian Seasoning as you like.) Season with salt and pepper.
7. Add drained penne, sauce, and 2 TBSP butter to pot used for pasta. Season with salt and pepper; stir to thoroughly combine. • Spread out half the pasta mixture in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Using a tablespoon, dollop pasta mixture with herbed ricotta. Top with remaining pasta mixture, then sprinkle with mozzarella.
8. Cover baking dish with foil. (TIP: Coat inside of foil with nonstick spray first to prevent sticking.) Bake pasta on top rack for 10 minutes, then remove from oven; discard foil. • Heat broiler to high. Broil until cheese is lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning. • Let cool slightly; top with chili flakes if desired. Divide between plates and serve.
