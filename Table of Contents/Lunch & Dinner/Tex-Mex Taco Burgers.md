The HF burger lab is open and they’ve invented a crowd-pleasing mashup of ground beef, Tex-Mex seasoning, and scallions. Griddle to juicy perfection, then tuck into fluffy toasted potato buns spread with guacamole and layered with sliced tomato. Serve blue tortilla chips on the side to make burger night an instant fiesta.

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 2 tomatoes
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1 tbsp tex-mex paste OR 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 4 potato bun
- 8 tbsp guacamole
- 3 ounce blue corn tortilla chips


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions. Thinly slice tomato into rounds; season with salt and pepper.
2. In a large bowl, combine beef*, scallions, and the Tex-Mex paste. Form mixture into four patties, each slightly wider than a burger bun. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add patties; cook until browned on one side, 3-5 minutes. • Flip, then reduce heat to medium low and cover. Cook to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes more. TIP: The Tex-Mex paste will release oil and splatter a little; lower heat if necessary.
3. Meanwhile, halve and toast buns.
4. Fill buns with patties; top with guacamole and as many tomato slices as you like. • Divide burgers and tortilla chips between plates. Serve.

## Notes
Serves 4.

*Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.*
