This recipe is here to blow up everything you think you know about meatballs. All dramatics aside, these meatballs are truly game-changing thanks to a certain onomatopoeic sauce. What exactly is “firecracker,” you ask? Well, mystery asker, it’s a creamy, spicy, sweet, and savory (yes, all those things!) sauce so good, it’ll make your taste buds explode! Once the meatballs are baked, they’re tossed in the magical condiment, then plated atop sesame-seed-flecked rice along with roasted carrots (AKA more things to dip in sauce). Don’t be surprised when you find yourself swiping up every last drop.

## Ingredients
- 560g ground beef or bison
- 1 tsp oil
- 2 scallions
- 1 tsp ginger
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tsp honey
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp sriracha
- ½ cup panko breadcrumbs
- 12 oz green beans
- 120g cooked rice


## Directions
1. Turn on oven to 425. 
2. Separate scallion whites and greens. 
3. In a large bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, honey, 4 tsp soy sauce, and sriracha. 
4. In second bowl, combine beef, panko, scallion whites, ginger, remaining soy sauce, 1.5 tsp salt, and pepper. Form into 20-24 balls. 
5. Placed meatballs on lightly oiled baking sheet. Toss green beans in 1 tsp of oil, salt, and pepper. 
6. Add green beans to baking sheet (or second sheet if not enough room). 
7. Bake meatballs and green beans for 14-16 minutes. 
8. Once meatballs are done, toss in sauce to coat. 
9. Eat over cooked rice.
