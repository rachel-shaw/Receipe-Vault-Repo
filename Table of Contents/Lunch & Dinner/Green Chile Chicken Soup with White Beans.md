Before it became a comforting bowl of soup, green chile chicken has roots that date back to indigenous culinary practices and Spanish influence.  Green chiles are native to the Americas and have been widely celebrated for their zest and medicinal properties. When the Spanish arrived, they helped introduce the art of blending tender meats like beef, lamb, and chicken with the tang of green chiles.  This was/is primarily popular in present-day southwestern US and parts of Mexico. From this came the classic green chile chicken dish people love today!

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small white onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 lb Rotisserie white chicken meat, pulled
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- _2 teaspoons white black pepper *_
- 3.5 cups low sodium chicken broth, warmed
- 1 cup mild salsa verde
- 2 cans (30oz) cannellini beans
- 1/3 cup cilantro, finely chopped
- sea salt & pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons arrowroot or cornstarch

**Garnish**
- avocado slices
- red onion, chopped


## Directions
1. Set a pot on medium heat.  Once hot, add olive oil, onion, and bell pepper.  Saute for 2 – 3 minutes or until fragrant.
2. Remove the skin from the rotisserie chicken and then tear the chicken breasts into pieces.
3. Add the garlic, chicken, and spices to the pot and mix for 1 – 2 minutes using a wooden spatula.
4. Add beans, green salsa, and warm chicken broth, stir, and bring to a gentle simmer.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
5. If you desire a thicker soup, mix arrowroot with 2 tablespoons of water and then add to the soup and stir immediately to thicken.  Remove the soup from the heat, add cilantro, and then season to taste with sea salt & pepper.
6. Enjoy green chile chicken soup with avocado pieces, cilantro, and red onion slices!  Store in an airtight container for 5 – 7 days in the fridge, or several months in the freezer.
