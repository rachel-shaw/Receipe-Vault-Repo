Ever ordered egg rolls for the kids and eaten most of them yourself? Our chefs have, too, which is why they created this deconstructed egg roll in a bowl. Less fried, but still super tasty because we’d never tease you like that! Crisp, browned pork is coated in a sweet, tangy sauce while shredded egg roll veggies are sauteed in a savory sesame-soy mixture. Everything is layered over buttery rice with a spicy-sweet duck sauce—just like your fave takeout—all in under 30 minutes!

## Ingredients
- 1.5 cup jasmine rice
- 2 yellow onion
- 4 tbsp apricot jam
- 4 ounce sweet thai chili sauce
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 20 ounce ground pork
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 8 ounce coleslaw mix
- 8 ounce shredded carrots
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 scoops crispy fried onions
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. In a small pot, combine rice, 2¼ cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
2. Wash and dry produce. • Thinly slice onion.
3. In a small bowl, combine apricot jam, chili sauce, half the soy sauce, and 5 TBSP hot water. Set apricot-chili duck sauce aside.
4. In a large pan, heat a drizzle of oil over medium-high heat. Add pork*, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Using a spatula, press into an even layer. Cook, without stirring, until browned on bottom, 3-4 minutes. • Break up meat into pieces and continue cooking until pork is cooked through, 1-2 minutes more. Add half the apricot-chili duck sauce; cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is glazed and coated, 1-3 minutes more. • Turn off heat. Transfer pork to a plate; tent with foil until ready to serve. Wipe out pan.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add coleslaw mix, carrots, and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, 5-7 minutes. • Add sesame oil and remaining soy sauce. Cook, stirring, until flavors meld, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Fluff rice with a fork and stir in 2 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between bowls; top with pork, veggies, and crispy fried onions. Drizzle with remaining apricot-chili duck sauce. Serve.
