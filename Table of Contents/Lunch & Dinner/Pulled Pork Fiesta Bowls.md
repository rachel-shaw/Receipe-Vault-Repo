We like to call these “fiesta bowls” because they know just how to stir things up at dinnertime. They’ve got all the best ingredients for making your taste buds boogie: tender precooked pulled pork, warm spices, and a tangy tomato salsa. Plus, garnishes like Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream, and herbaceous cilantro are guaranteed to keep the vibes lively. But the real story of the night might be that this dish can be on the table in as little as 20 minutes.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 2 red onion
- 2 green bell pepper
- 2 roma tomato
- 1/2 cilantro
- 2 limes
- 20 ounce pulled pork
- 2 tbsp [[Fajita Spice Blend]]
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1/2 Monterey Jack cheese
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. In a small pot, combine 1½ cup water and 2 TBSP butter. Bring to a boil, then stir in rice. Cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
2. Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 3 TBSP. Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Dice tomato. Finely chop cilantro. Quarter lime.
3. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring, until just softened, 3-4 minutes.
4. Tear pulled pork into smaller pieces. Add to pan with veggies along with another large drizzle of oil. Season with Fajita Spice, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring, until pork is warmed through, 2-3 minutes. Stir in stock concentrate and ¾ cup water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and stir in 2 TBSP butter. Simmer until saucy, 1-2 minutes.
5. While pork simmers, in a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, half the cilantro, juice from half the lime, salt, and pepper.
6. Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls. Top with pork mixture, salsa, and Monterey Jack. Dollop with sour cream and sprinkle with remaining cilantro. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
