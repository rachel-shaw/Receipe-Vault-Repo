If nothing says “date night” like a juicy steak, then this dish is the equivalent of getting down on one knee. Beef tenderloin is pan-seared until it’s perfectly tender and forms a delectable crust (cue the swoons). But it doesn’t stop there: A rich, buttery sauce flecked with freshly cracked black peppercorns amps up the savory notes in the beef. On the side, there’s delicately crisp green beans and roasted potatoes. No matter who you cook this for, we have a good feeling they’ll be quite smitten.

## Ingredients
- 24 gold potatoes
- 12 ounce green beans
- 2 shllots
- 2 tbsp black peppercorns
- 1/2 ounce chives
- 20 ounce beef tenderloin filets
- 2 unit (tsp?) beef demi-glace ([Savory Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Savory-Choice-Glace-Reduction-Packet/dp/B00ILZ9SNG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YYVTCWVE2UKS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yPHae0ZHPUVYCOHRhy-JaGsFpSwCAI4ftI6fPhyU3qbt36cafMUIV3A5YAMyDzULOp_FXBXTgMO6PyZd_GupoTsah-MytgLkdErEoPMP_ScI2B_k27tKPea4JvMzXHOl8lhqvA2KYF-xVVjbTh821BPV6BopDv6ReCQAZOh_NAZBM8ym5P6d0AV4J6GkB1MTEI6Rk4QvCwIu9av0BXlcVQV46-O23CNPG_FKqKXWzNQWXvKjrusvG4464h4ugIJP_XlRVP8ZE6W1wCjjT-V57mfWPLZOKYKDWDEvz1bsIK0SsSlt21Z2n93qEfvITKvoxtvPxRT3HpApjbfuDkZS-jUaqhh-mpLiS-vVVrg2JSo.Ymk2z9TneiLTfXE-7LN-dr1OSqXitTwtP7co3gLVBhE&dib_tag=se&keywords=savory+choice+beef+demi+glace&qid=1736622352&s=grocery&sprefix=savory+choice+beef+demi+glaz%2Cgrocery%2C129&sr=1-1) is good brand)
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top and bottom positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Trim green beans if necessary. Halve, peel, and mince shallot until you have 2 TBSP. Place peppercorns in a zip-close bag; crush with a rolling pin or a heavy-bottomed pan. Thinly slice chives.
2. Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil and a big pinch of salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until lightly browned, 10 minutes (you’ll add more to the sheet then).
3. Once potatoes are lightly browned, leave potatoes roasting. Carefully toss green beans on another sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast green beans on bottom rack until veggies are browned and tender, 10-15 minutes more.
4. While veggies roast, pat beef * dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook to desired doneness, 4-7 minutes per side. • Turn off heat; transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Wash out pan.
5. Melt 1 TBSP butter in same pan over medium heat. Add minced shallot and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 1 minute. • Add demi-glace, 1⁄3 cup water, 1 tsp crushed peppercorns, and any resting juices from beef. Simmer until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. • Turn off heat. Stir in another 2 TBSP butter and half the chives. Season with salt and more peppercorns if desired.
6. Divide potatoes, green beans, and beef between plates. Top beef with sauce. Sprinkle with remaining chives and serve.
