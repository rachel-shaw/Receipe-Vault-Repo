We jump at every chance to dig into a pot pie, and how better to impress and entice a new boo? The only problem: Who has time to make a homemade crust on a weeknight? Enter: biscuit crust, a rich, flaky, time-saving dinner hack. We layer the dough over a creamy, homestyle filling of ground turkey, fresh thyme, and sautéed veggies, then swipe with melted butter and sprinkle with more thyme. It’s baked until the filling is steamy and the crust is perfectly golden-brown for a comforting dinner that’s easy as—what else?—pie!

## Ingredients
- 560g ground turkey or chicken
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 12 oz carrots, diced
- 2.5 oz celery, diced
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 tsp garlic, minced
- ¼ oz thyme, minced (fresh)
- 3 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp flour
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 4 tbsp cream cheese
- 12 oz Pillsbury Southern Homestyle Buttermilk Biscuits


## Directions
1. Set oven to 425. Heat oil in overproof pan over medium heat. 
2. Add turkey and pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until browned and transfer to plate. 
3. Reserve ½ tsp of thyme to use later. 
4. Add carrots, celery, and diced onion with salt and pepper to pan; cook until softened, 5-7 minutes. 
5. Add garlic and non-reserved thyme to pan and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. 
6. Add 2 tbsp butter to pan with veggies, cook until melted. 
7. Stir in flour, cook for 1 minute. 
8. Pour in 1 ¾ cup water and stock concentrate, salt, pepper. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, 3-5 minutes. 
9. Turn off heat. 
10. Stir in cream cheese until melted, add turkey back in. Season with salt and pepper. 
11. Place 1 tbsp butter in microwave until melted. 
12. Place biscuits on top of meat and veggies (can cut into quarters for crispier topping). 
13. Top biscuits with melted butter and reserved thyme. 
14. Bake on top rack until biscuits are browned, 12-15 minutes. Let sit 3-5 minutes before serving.
