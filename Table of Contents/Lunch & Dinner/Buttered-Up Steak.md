This week’s entry into the HelloFresh Hall of Fame is an all-time favorite thanks to the compound butter—that’s soft butter mixed with herbs and seasonings. For chefs, this ingredient is the ultimate secret weapon because it’s just about the easiest and most instantaneous way to sauce a dish. Here, it’s dabbed onto steak for an intensely rich effect. But we think you might find yourself adding it to everything once you see how it rewards with simple deliciousness.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce sirloin steak
- 24 ounce gold potatoes
- 4 garlic gloves
- 1/4 ounce parsley
- 12 ounce green beans
- 2 tsp dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. **Wash and dry all produce.** Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Take out **1 TBSP butter** and **steak** and let sit at room temperature. Peel **potatoes**, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Thinly slice **garlic**. Finely chop **parsley**.
2. Toss **potatoes** on a baking sheet with a drizzle of **oil** and a pinch of **salt** and **pepper**. Roast in oven until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes total (we’ll be adding more items to the sheet before the potatoes are done)
3. Heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. Pat **steak** dry with a paper towel. Add to pan and cook until browned on surface, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet with potatoes. Roast to desired doneness, 5-7 minutes. Remove from sheet and let rest 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of **oil** in same pan over medium heat. Add **green beans** and cook, tossing, until tender but still a little crisp, 4-5 minutes. Add **garlic** and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with **salt** and **pepper**.
5. In a small bowl, mix **butter, 1 tsp Dijon mustard**, and a pinch of **parsley**. Season with **salt** and **pepper**.
6. Slice **steak** against the grain. Top with **herb butter**. Serve with **green beans** and **potatoes** on the side. Garnish with any remaining **parsley**.
