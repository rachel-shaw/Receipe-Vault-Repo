This burger that stacks up against the best, literally: each bun holds a beef patty that’s been smothered in melted pepper jack cheese AND sautéed peppers and onions. Just in case that doesn’t make this burger a front-runner for first-place, let’s introduce the secret weapon: a special spicy ketchup with hot sauce that you can add to taste. If you aren’t blown away yet, you will be when you’re holding this bad boy in your hands.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce gold potatoes
- 2 yellow onion
- 2 long green peppers
- 4 tbsp ketchup
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 2 tbsp [[Smokey BBQ Seasoning]]
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1 cup pepper jack cheese
- 4 potato buns


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper into strips. • In a small bowl, combine ketchup with hot sauce to taste.
2. Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the BBQ Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack, flipping halfway through, until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.
3. While potatoes roast, heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and green pepper. Cook, stirring, until browned and softened, 7-9 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat; remove from pan and set aside. Wipe out pan.
4. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine beef*, remaining BBQ Seasoning, and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Form mixture into four wide, roughly ½-inch-thick rounds. Set aside half the pepper jack. Divide remaining cheese between centers of each round. Fold edges of meat around cheese, shaping and sealing to create cheese-stuffed patties, each slightly wider than a burger bun. Season all over with salt and pepper.
5. Heat a large drizzle of oil in pan used for veggies over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. • In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top each patty with a layer of veggies (you may have some left over), then top with reserved pepper jack; cover pan to melt cheese.
6. While patties cook, halve and toast buns. • Spread cut sides of buns with spicy ketchup. Place smothered patties on bottom buns; drizzle with any remaining hot sauce if desired, then add top buns. • Divide burgers between plates and serve with potatoes and any remaining veggies on the side.
