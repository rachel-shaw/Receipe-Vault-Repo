This saucy, sweet, and spicy dish is ready in just 15 minutes—that’s faster than it takes to order delivery! Ground pork is browned with cabbage and scallions, then simmered in a blend of sweet Thai chili sauce, soy glaze, hoisin, and lime juice. It’s all spooned over buttery rice and garnished with sesame seeds for a nutty crunch.
