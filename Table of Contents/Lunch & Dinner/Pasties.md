## Ingredients
**Ingredients for Filling**
- 2 lb round steak
- 1 ½ cup carrots
- 1 small onion
- 5-6 cups potatoes
- ¾ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp pepper
- 1-2 tbsp worcestershire sauce 
- montreal steak seasoning
- 1 egg

**Ingredients for Crust**
- 6 cups of flour
- 1 ½ cups Crisco
- 3/4 cup butter
- 1/3 tsp salt
- 1 cup of ICE water

## Directions
**Filling**: 
1. Cut steak into ½ -¾ inch squares and trim off all fat. *Cuts best when in semi-frozen state that is solid enough to permit slicing while still retaining shape.*
2. Carrots, onion and potatoes should be sliced and then very coarsely ground in a food processor or similar device. 
3. Mix all ingredients together, adding worcestershire sauce and Montreal Steak Seasoning to taste.
4. Strain liquid out – set aside and prepare crust.
	
**Crust**:
1. Mix all but water with pre-blender (wire stirrer – half moon shaped ) until consistency of peas.  (small pea size balls)
2. Add ¾ cup ICE water.  Mix with fork until well blended and forms a ball.  
3. Dump out on a floured cloth.  
4. Divide into 6 even balls.  
5. Cover with wet paper towel until ready to roll out.

 **To Prepare:**
1.  Roll out one ball at a time into a circle – in the middle of the circle put about 1 ½ cups of filling and a pat of butter on top of the mix.  
 2. Fold dough over mixture into a crescent shape.  Crimp edges.   
 3. Put oven rack up to second position.  
 4. Bake at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes. 
 5. When done remove carefully from baking sheet and place on freezer like paper, (not waxed). 
 6. Let cool. When cooled completely, wrap thoroughly in tin foil. Placed in individual plastic bags and put in freezer. Can be kept in freezer for 3 months.
## Notes
**Yield**: 6 Pasties

**Re-heat**: Remove from freezer and plastic bag. Place on baking tine in 400 degree oven for around 50 minutes. Open foil and cook an additional 10 minutes to brown the crust. Serve medium hot with ketchup or A-1 sauce. Dill pickles on side add a nice contrast.
