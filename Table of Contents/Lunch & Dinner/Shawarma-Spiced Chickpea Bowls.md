We swoon for shawarma. For this veggie-centric spin, we swap the traditional spit-roasted meat for roasted chickpeas, onion, and tomatoes, but keep all the same aromatic, warming spices. It’s all served over ultra-flavorful, spiced basmati rice that’s studded with pistachios. If you’re anything like us, one of our favorite parts about shawarma is the sauce selection—and don’t worry, we didn’t skimp. Drizzle hot sauce and a creamy, garlicky white sauce over the top, then prepare to be totally bowled over.

## Ingredients
- 2 red onions
- 1/2 cilantro
- 1 ounce pistachios
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 2 units chickpeas (2 cans?)
- 6 tbsp sour cream
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 lemons
- 8 ounce grape tomatoes
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 2 tbsp [[Shawarma Spice Blend (HelloFresh)]]
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel, and cut onion into 1⁄2-inch-thick wedges; mince a few wedges until you have 4 TBSP. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Roughly chop pistachios. Drain and rinse chickpeas; pat very dry with paper towels. Roughly chop cilantro. Zest and quarter lemon.
2. Melt 2 TBSP butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add minced onion, half the garlic, half the pistachios (save the rest for serving), half the Shawarma Spice Blend (you’ll use the rest in the next step), and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in rice, 1 1⁄2 cup water, stock concentrate, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to use in step 5.
3. Meanwhile, toss onion wedges, tomatoes, and chickpeas on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining Shawarma Spice Blend, pepper, and a few pinches of salt. Divide everything between 2 baking sheets; roast on top and middle racks, tossing veggies and swapping rack positions halfway through roasting, until veggies are tender and lightly charred and chickpeas are crispy, 18-20 minutes. (It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit.)
4. While veggies and chickpeas roast, in a small bowl, combine sour cream with remaining garlic to taste. Season with salt. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
5. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in half the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Toss veggies and chickpeas with lemon zest.
6. Divide rice between shallow bowls or plates. Top with veggies and chickpeas. Drizzle with garlicky white sauce and hot sauce to taste. Sprinkle with remaining pistachios and cilantro. Top with lemon juice to taste; serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
