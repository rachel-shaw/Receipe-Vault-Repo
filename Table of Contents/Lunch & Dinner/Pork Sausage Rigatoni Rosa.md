Fun fact: “Rosa” means “pink” in Italian. For our chefs’ version of rigatoni rosa, you’ll make a homemade pink sauce with a savory sausage base and a sprinkle of chili flakes (for a little heat!). Toss that with rigatoni and sautéed zucchini, then sprinkle Parmesan all over and we promise: you’ll be blushing from all the compliments you receive on this meal.

## Ingredients
- 12 ounce rigatoni pasta
- 2 zucchini
- 2 garlic cloves
- 18 ounce Italian pork sausage
- 3 ounce tomato paste
- 8 tbsp cream cheese
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 12 tbsp parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once water is boiling, add rigatoni; cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 1½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain and set aside. • Meanwhile, trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; slice crosswise into ¼-inch-thick half-moons. Peel and mince or grate garlic.
2. While pasta cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 5-6 minutes. Remove pan from heat; transfer zucchini to a plate. • Remove sausage* from casing; discard casing. • Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until almost cooked through, 3-4 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in the next step).
3. Stir garlic and tomato paste into pan with sausage; cook until garlic is fragrant, tomato paste is well distributed, and sausage is fully cooked, 1-2 minutes. • Stir in cream cheese, stock concentrate, ¾ cup reserved pasta cooking water (ladle straight from the pot if pasta hasn’t finished cooking yet), 2 TBSP butter, 1 tsp sugar, and a pinch of chili flakes to taste. Remove from heat.
4. Add drained rigatoni and zucchini to pan with sauce. Stir in half the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce. • Divide between bowls; top with remaining Parmesan and serve.

## Notes
Serves 4.

*Pork Sausage is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.
