Don’t get us wrong, we love a traditional taco—but when we’re in the mood to mix things up, we love taquitos, also known as rolled-up tacos with a crispy outer shell. Here, we achieve the signature taquito crunch factor by baking the stuffed tortillas (full of zesty pork and Mexican cheese) for perfectly golden results—no messy deep-frying required. That crispy crust is the perfect canvas for all our favorite toppings: pico de gallo, creamy guacamole, and hot sauce. Yes, you really can have it all.

## Ingredients
- 2 yellow onions
- 20 ounce ground pork
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 2 tbsp Tex-Mex Paste
- 1 cup Mexican cheese blend
- 12 flour tortillas
- 1 lime
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 8 tbsp guacamole
- 2 tsp hot sauce


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly oil (or spray with nonstick cooking spray). Wash and dry all produce. • Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP.
2. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion; cook for 3 minutes. • Add pork*; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until pork is browned and cooked through and onion is softened, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in Southwest Spice, Tex-Mex paste, and ½ cup water. Simmer until thickened, 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat.
3. Meanwhile, drizzle tortillas with 2 TBSP olive oil; brush or rub to completely coat. • Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Once pork filling is done, add a heaping ¼ cup filling to one side of each tortilla, then sprinkle each with 1 TBSP Mexican cheese. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to create taquitos. Place seam sides down on prepared sheet. TIP: Make sure the taquitos are snug on the sheet—this will prevent them from unrolling. • Bake on middle rack until golden brown and crispy, 8-12 minutes.
4. While taquitos bake, finely dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. • In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt. • In a separate small bowl, combine guacamole, sour cream, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. • Divide taquitos between plates. Top with pico de gallo, creamy guacamole, and hot sauce. Serve.
