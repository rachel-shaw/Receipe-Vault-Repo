The Southwest meets Italy in this skillet supper that has bold flavors that’ll warm you from the inside out—there’s twisty cavatappi, bites of flavorful ground beef, and sautéed poblano. It’s all topped with a Mexican cheese blend, smoky red pepper crema, tangy sour cream, and hot sauce for a little kick. A sprinkle of scallion greens adds an extra pop of color. Yes, one skillet has all that.

## Ingredients
- 2 poblano peppers
- 2 scallions
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 3 ounce tomato paste
- 12 ounce cavatappi pasta
- 4 tsp beef stock concentrate
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 8 tbsp [[Smoky Red Pepper Crema (HelloFresh)]]
- 1 cup Mexican cheese blend
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Halve, deseed, and thinly slice poblano into strips. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
2. Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 2 cup pasta cooking water, then drain. • Meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and season with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 4-5 minutes.
3. Add a drizzle of oil to pan with poblano; add beef* and scallion whites. Season with Southwest Spice, salt, and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out. • Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 seconds.
4. Add ¾ cup reserved pasta cooking water and stock concentrates to pan with beef mixture. Season with 1 tsp salt and a pinch of pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, 2-3 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to low and stir in drained cavatappi, sour cream, smoky red pepper crema, half the Mexican cheese (you’ll use the rest in the next step), 2 TBSP butter, and hot sauce to taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.
6. Top beef cavatappi with remaining Mexican cheese; cover pan until cheese melts, 1-2 minutes. Top with scallion greens and serve.
