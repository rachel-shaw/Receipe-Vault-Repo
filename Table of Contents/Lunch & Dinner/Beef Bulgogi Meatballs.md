Obsessed with [meatballs](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/%3Ca%20href=&quot;https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/meatball-recipes)">[https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/meatball-recipes'&gt;meatballs](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/meatball-recipes'&gt;meatballs) but ready to break out of your usual routine? This ballin’ dish has just the thing. Here, we’ve ditched marinara sauce and spaghetti for savory-sweet bulgogi glaze and fluffy, ginger-scented white rice. As a bonus, there’s a side of roasted carrots and a drizzle of sriracha crema. Say hasta la vista to pasta and prepare yourself for a flavor explosion.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce carrots
- 4 scallions
- 2 thumbs ginger
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 16 tbsp bulgogi sauce
- 1.5 cup jasmine rice
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 1 tsp sriracha
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds


## Directions
1. Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into ½-inch-thick pieces. Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.
2. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Peel and mince or grate ginger.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in rice, 2¼ cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
4. In a large bowl, combine beef, scallion whites, panko, remaining ginger, and 2 TBSP bulgogi sauce. Season with 1½ tsp salt and pepper. Form into 1½-inch meatballs; transfer to a second baking sheet. Bake meatballs on middle rack until browned and cooked through, 14-16 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and sriracha to taste. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Once meatballs are done, carefully transfer to a second large bowl; add remaining bulgogi sauce and toss to coat.
6. Fluff rice with a fork; taste and season with salt if desired. Divide between plates and top with carrots, meatballs, and any remaining bulgogi sauce. Drizzle with sriracha crema. Garnish with scallion greens and as many sesame seeds as you like and serve.
