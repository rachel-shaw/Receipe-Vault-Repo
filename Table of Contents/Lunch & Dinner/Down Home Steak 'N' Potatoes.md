Remember speed dial? Speed dating? Speed skating? Well get ready for speed dinner–from box to plate in 15 minutes (or less!), and it’s no slouch. Lean, old-school, beefy steak is quick seared, then finished with garlic-herb butter and drizzled with a mustard cream sauce. It’s served with a side of buttery steamed potatoes, and a fresh mixed green salad. A real homey, robust, and fuss-free meal idea for any weeknight.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce potatoes
- 2 tomatoes
- 4 tbsp garlic herb butter
- 20 ounce ranch steak
- 4 ounce [[Cream Sauce Base (HelloFresh)]]
- 2 tsp dijon mustard
- 4 ounce mixed green
- 8 ounce shredded carrots
- 5 tsp balsamic vinegar


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Quarter potatoes. Cut tomato into wedges. • Place potatoes and half the garlic herb butter in a microwave-safe bowl; season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap; microwave until tender, 6-7 minutes. Keep covered.
2. Pat steak* dry and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle oil in a hot pan. Cook steak to desired doneness, 3-6 minutes per side. • To finish steak, add remaining garlic herb butter and spoon over. Transfer to a cutting board; reserve butter in pan.
3. In a second microwave-safe bowl, mix the cream sauce, the mustard, and a big pinch of pepper. Cover with plastic wrap; microwave 40 seconds. • In a third bowl, toss mixed greens, tomato, carrots, the vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
4. Thinly slice steak against the grain. • Spoon melted butter over steak and drizzle with creamy mustard sauce. Serve with salad and potatoes.
## Notes
Serves 4.

*Steak is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.*
