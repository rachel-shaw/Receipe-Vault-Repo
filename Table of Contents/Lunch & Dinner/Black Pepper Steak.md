## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
- 14 oz steak
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- ⅓ cup brandy or cognac
- 1 cup cream
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard


## Directions
1. Wrap the peppercorns in a lint-free kitchen towel, then smash with the bottom of a skillet until coarsely crushed.
2. Liberally season the steak on all sides with the salt and crushed peppercorns, using your hands to press the seasoning into the meat to create an even coating.
3. Heat the vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add the steak to the pan and sear for 4 minutes. Flip and sear the other side for another 4 minutes, for medium-rare. If steak has a fat-cap on its side, be sure to sear it as well for 30–60 seconds. Once cooked to desired doneness, transfer the steak to a cutting board to rest.
4. Reduce the heat to medium and add the brandy to the skillet. Allow the brandy to cook down for about 1 minute while using a whisk to scrape up any browned bits in the bottom of the pan. Once the brandy has reduced by half, add the cream, mustard, and remaining tablespoon of butter and continue to cook until the mixture begins to reduce and thicken, 5-7 minutes. The sauce should have a rich consistency and coat the back of a spoon.
5. Slice the steak into ½-inch (1½-cm) pieces. Pour the sauce over the top and serve.


## Notes
*Optional:* Add 1 tbsp of brown sauce gravy powder (from packet) to mix in with butter when making gravy. It adds a little extra taste.

We love to make this for our traditional Christmas meal! 

You can skip the brandy and it still tastes great.

Serves 2.
