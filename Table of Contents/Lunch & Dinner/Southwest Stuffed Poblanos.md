Mild, earthy, sweet, and perfect for stuffing, poblano peppers are one of our favorite ingredients to use in quick (and delicious) dinners. Speaking of stuffing, we combined protein-rich quinoa with fresh tomato, sweet corn, and Southwestern spices for a twist on the traditional Italian profile. Once filled, the peppers receive a sprinkle of melty Pepper Jack and out of the oven, a dollop of zesty lime crema. These packed peppers are sure to satisfy.

## Ingredients
- 4 poblano peppers
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 4 scallions
- 2 limes
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 tbsp sour cream
- 26.8 ounce corn
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 1 cup pepper jack cheese (shredded)


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Halve poblanos lengthwise; remove ribs and seeds. Dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lime both limes. 
2. In a small pot, combine 2 cup water, stock concentrate, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then add quinoa, cover, and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until quinoa is tender and water has evaporated, 15-20 minutes. TIP: Drain any excess water, if necessary.
3. While quinoa cooks, rub poblano halves with oil; season with salt and pepper. Place cut sides down on a baking sheet. Roast on middle rack until tender, 18-20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream, lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Drain corn and pat dry with paper towels. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over high heat. Add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly charred, 4-6 minutes. (TIP: If corn begins to pop, cover pan.) Reduce heat to medium and add tomato, scallion whites, and Southwest Spice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato breaks down, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
5. Stir cooked quinoa into pan with veggies; season with salt and pepper. Once poblanos are done roasting, stuff each half with as much filling as will fit. Place in pan with remaining filling, nestling each poblano half into the grain mixture. (TIP: If your pan isn't ovenproof, transfer mixture to a small baking dish and arrange stuffed poblanos in there.) Sprinkle evenly with pepper jack. Heat broiler to high or oven to 500 degrees.
6. Transfer stuffed poblanos to middle rack; broil or bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. Remove from oven and top with lime crema and scallion greens. Divide between plates. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
