Does your love for pasta know no bounds? We’ve got the perfect recipe for any self-professed carb connoisseur. Al dente spaghetti, sun-dried tomatoes, juicy grape tomatoes, and fresh basil come together in a combination that’s hearty, satisfying, and classically comforting. Just add a sprinkle of Parmesan and crunchy toasted almonds over the top to take things...well, over the top!

## Ingredients
- 3 ounce sun-dried tomatoes
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 ounce basil (fresh)
- 8 ounce grape tomatoes
- 12 ounce spaghetti
- 1 ounce almonds
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 4 tbsp cream cheese
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Finely chop sun-dried tomatoes. Mince or grate garlic. Halve grape tomatoes lengthwise; place in a small bowl and toss with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pick basil leaves from stems; roughly chop leaves.
2. Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
3. Meanwhile, heat a large, dry pan over medium-high heat. Add almonds and cook, stirring often, until fragrant and lightly browned, 3-4 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a second small bowl. Wipe out pan.
4. Heat 1 TBSP butter and a drizzle of olive oil in pan used for almonds over medium heat. Add sun-dried tomatoes and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in stock concentrate and ½ cup plain water. Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, 1-2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and whisk in cream cheese until fully incorporated.
5. Stir grape tomatoes into sauce. Add spaghetti, 2 TBSP butter, and half the Parmesan (save the rest for serving); toss to combine. (TIP: If needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.) Stir in half the basil and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
6. Divide pasta between bowls. Top with almonds and remaining Parmesan and basil. Serve.
