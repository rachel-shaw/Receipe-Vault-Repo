Love beef and broccoli? Then you’ll adore our tasty twist on the tried-and-true takeout classic. Seared, diced steak is simmered in teriyaki sauce that’s spiked with fresh ginger and lime juice, then tossed with lightly charred broccoli. On the side, there’s a heap of steamy rice (aka the perfect vessel for catching any delicious runoff sauce). Skip the takeout joint and find out how easy and tasty it is to whip up this dish in your very own kitchen...in 30 minutes, no less!

## Ingredients
- 16 ounce broccoli florets
- 2 thumb ginger
- 1 lime
- 1 chili pepper
- 1.5 cup jasmine rice
- 20 ounce diced steak
- 8 ounce teriyaki sauce
- 1 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. If necessary, cut broccoli florets into bitesized pieces. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Zest and quarter lime. Thinly slice chili, removing seeds for less heat.
2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger and cook until fragrant, 20-30 seconds. Add rice, 2¼ cups water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Add broccoli and 1 TBSP water. Cover and let steam until bright green, 4-5 minutes. Uncover and add a large drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Cook, uncovered, until broccoli is tender and lightly charred, 2-4 minutes more. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wash out pan.
4. Pat diced steak dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil to pan used for broccoli over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook, without stirring, until well browned, 3-5 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, 2-3 minutes more. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.
5. Add remaining ginger to pan with diced steak and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add teriyaki sauce and as much lime juice as you like. Stir in broccoli until warmed through; turn off heat. TIP: If you like a sweeter sauce, add a pinch or two of sugar.
6. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter and lime zest to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls and top with steak and broccoli mixture. If you like spicy food, sprinkle with as much chili as you like. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.
