This works perfectly as a quick meal, but it's so good it doubles as homemade gourmet when you have guests. Serve with a baked potato or side of your choice.

- ⅛ cup olive oil
- 1 red bell pepper
- ½ onion, sliced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ cup white wine
- 1 tomatoes
- ¼ cup low-fat parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup mozzarella cheese


## Directions
1. Begin by brushing the chicken breasts with pesto.
2. Next, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
3. Add red peppers and onions along with garlic and continue to cook until slightly tender.
4. Place chicken into the pan and cook until browned and no longer pink inside.
5. Add in the tomatoes and white wine, turn down to low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Finally, sprinkle with Parmesan and mozzarella cheese, cooking for 30-60 longer or until cheese is slightly melted.
