The week just isn’t complete without taco night. If you agree (and how could you not?), you’re in luck! Our chefs put together a Tex Mex–style taco that’s sure to satisfy. There’s citrusy pork, bell pepper, and pickled onion, all piled into steamy-soft tortillas. Drizzle it all with a Southwest-spiced crema and you’re ready for a truly spec-TACO-lar meal.

## Ingredients
- 560g ground pork, turkey, or beef
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 2 long green peppers
- 2 oranges
- ¼ oz cilantro
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tbsp tex-mex paste
- 12 flour tortillas
- ¼ tsp sugar


## Directions
1. In a small bowl, combine ¼ of the onion, 1.5 tbsp lime juice, ¼ tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt. Microwave for 30 seconds. 
2. In a separate bowl, combine sour cream, ¼ tsp southwest spice blend, salt, pepper, and enough water until reaches drizzling consistency. 
3. Heat oil in pan, cook green pepper and remaining onion until browned. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. 
4. Brown meat with remaining southwest blend, then add in Tex-Mex paste and ½ tbsp lime juice. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce has thickened (2-3 minutes). 
5. Divide veggies, meat, pickled onion (draining first), crema, and cilantro among tortillas.

## Notes
Serves 4.
