![[Chipotle-Beef-Black-Bean-and-Sweet-Potato-Stew.jpeg]]

This recipe was a finalist for the National Beef Cook-Off. The trick here is to microwave the potato before adding it to the stew to make the meal preparation go much faster. The addition of chipotle peppers gives the stew an enticing smoky flavor.

## Ingredients
- 1 medium sweet potato peeled
- 3/4 - 1 lb. 95% lean ground beef, turkey, or meatless crumble
- 1 yellow onion chopped
- 28 - 30 oz. reduced-sodium canned black beans drained and rinsed
- 28 oz. crushed tomatoes
- 1 - 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce with some of the sauce, minced
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro chopped
- 1 - 2 lime 2 Tbsp. juice, plus 6 wedges


## Directions
1. Pierce the sweet potato with a fork. Microwave it on top of a paper towel on high for 4 – 6 minutes until it is tender. Let it cool slightly and cut it into 1/2–inch cubes.
2. Meanwhile, in a heavy stockpot, brown the beef and onions, breaking up the beef as it cooks, until it is cooked through, 8 – 10 minutes. (If using vegetarian ground “meat,” add it with the beans and tomatoes.)
3. Add the beans, tomatoes, and chipotle peppers. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer it, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
4. Add the sweet potatoes and cook 5 more minutes until it is heated through, stirring once.
5. Sprinkle the stew with the cilantro and lime juice. Serve it immediately, garnished with lime wedges, if desired, or refrigerate it for up to 3 days.

## Notes
- No need to pre-cook the sweet potato. Simply put all the ingredients (except the cilantro and lime) into the slow cooker and cook it on low for 6 – 7 hours, or high for 3 – 4 hours until the ground beef is fully cooked and the potatoes are softened. Top it with the cilantro and lime as directed above. (Slow cooker cooking times may vary—Get to know your slow cooker and, if necessary, adjust cooking times accordingly.)
