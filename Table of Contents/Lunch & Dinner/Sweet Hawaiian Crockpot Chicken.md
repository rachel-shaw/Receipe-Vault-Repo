This Sweet Hawaiian Crockpot Chicken is loaded with tropical flavor. Chicken thighs and a colorful blend of bell peppers are cooked low and slow in a thick, sweet, and tangy pineapple brown sugar sauce then served over rice!

## Ingredients
- 2 lb. (.9kg) chicken tenderloin chunks
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 1 can of pineapple chunks
- 1 red onion, chopped
- 2 bell peppers, diced


## Directions
1. Combine all together, cook on low in Crock-pot 6-8 hours…that’s it! Done!

## Notes
- Don’t like canned pineapple? Substitute diced fresh or frozen pineapple!
- Don’t have chicken breasts? Use boneless, skinless thighs, and add about 20 minutes to cook time.
- For extra veggies, add a diced bell pepper and/or red onion.
