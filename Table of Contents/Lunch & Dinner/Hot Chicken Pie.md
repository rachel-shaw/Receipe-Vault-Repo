## Ingredients
**Ingredients for Chicken**
- 4 lb oven-ready chicken
- 1 small onion, skinned and halved
- 1 carrot, peeled
- 1 stick of celery, scrubbed
- 6 peppercorns
- salt

**Ingredients for Sauce:**
- 2 ounce butter
- 6 ounce (3/4 cup) onion, skinned and chopped
- 1/2 lb sweet red peppers, seeded and finely chopped
- 2 ounce green chilis, halved and seeded
- 4 tbsp flour (leveled)
- 1 pint (2.5 cups) chicken stock (made during recipe)
- 4 ounce cheddar cheese, grated
- salt and pepper

**Ingredients for Pie Crust:**
- 6 ounce puff pastry (i.e. made with 6 ounce flour) OR 13 ounce frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1 egg, beaten



## Directions
1. Simmer the chicken in sufficient water to cover the vegetables (onion, carrot, celery), peppercorns and salt, for about 2 hours.
2. Remove chicken, reduce the liquor to 1 pint by rapid boiling and then strain. This is the chicken stock. 
3. For the sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan. Fry chopped onion, sweet red peppers, and chilis for 10 minutes. If wished, the chilis may be removed at this stage.
4. Carve the chicken, cutting it into fork-sized pieces, and discard the skin.
5. Place the meat in a 3-pint pie dish with a funnel. 
6. Blend the flour into the fried vegetables and slowly add the strained stock, stirring continuously. Bring to a boil.
7. When the liquid has thickened, add the cheese and adjust the seasoning. Spoon over chicken and allow to cool.
8. Roll out the puff pastry and use to cover the filled pie dish. Knock up and scallop the edge and score the top of the pastry into diamonds with a knife. 
9. Glaze with beaten egg, place on a baking sheet and cook in the oven at 450$^\circ$ for 30 minutes.
10. Reduce heat to 325$^\circ$ and cook for a further 30 minutes.
