We swoon for shawarma. For this veggie-centric spin, we swap the traditional spit-roasted meat for roasted chickpeas, onion, and tomatoes, but keep the same aromatic, warming spices. It’s all served over spiced basmati rice that’s studded with pistachios. If you’re anything like us, one of our favorite parts about shawarma is the sauce—and don’t worry, we didn’t skimp. Drizzle over a creamy, garlicky white sauce and some hot sauce, then prepare to be totally bowled over.

## Ingredients
- 2 red onions
- 1/4 ounce cilantro
- 1 ounce pistachios
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 26.8 ounce chickpeas
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon
- 2 roma tomato
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 2 tbsp [[Shawarma Spice Blend (HelloFresh)]]
- 1 tsp hot sauce
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Halve, peel, and cut onion into ½-inch-thick wedges; mince a few wedges until you have 4 TBSP. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Roughly chop pistachios. Cut tomato into ½-inch-thick wedges. Drain and rinse chickpeas; pat very dry with paper towels. Roughly chop cilantro. Zest and quarter lemon.
2. Melt 2 TBSP butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add minced onion, half the garlic, half the pistachios (save the rest for serving), half the Shawarma Spice (you’ll use the rest in the next step), and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in rice, 1½ cup water, stock concentrate, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to use in step 5.
3. Meanwhile, toss onion wedges, tomato, and chickpeas on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining Shawarma Spice, pepper, and a few pinches of salt. Divide everything between 2 baking sheets; roast on top and middle racks, tossing veggies and swapping rack positions halfway through roasting.  Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until veggies are tender and lightly charred and chickpeas are crispy, 18-20 minutes. TIP: It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit while roasting.
4. While veggies and chickpeas roast, in a small bowl, combine sour cream with remaining garlic to taste. Season with salt. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
5. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter and half the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. • Once veggies and chickpeas are done, carefully toss with lemon zest.
6. Divide rice between shallow bowls. Top with veggies and chickpeas. Drizzle with garlicky white sauce and hot sauce to taste. Sprinkle with remaining pistachios and remaining cilantro. Top with lemon juice to taste; serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
