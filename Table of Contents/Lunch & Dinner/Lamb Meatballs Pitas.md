The Greeks have been making this dish for centuries, and for good reason too! Savory lamb meatballs are balanced with fresh veggies for crunch and color. Stuff it all into a toasted pita with a dill-yogurt sauce to cool it down!

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce ground lamb
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp allspice
- 2 bunches dill
- 4 whole wheat pitas
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 red onions
- 2 lemons
- 2 sprigs mint
- 2 heads romaine lettuce
- 2 tomatoes
- 4 zucchinis


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Halve, peel, and thinly slice half the red onion. Finely chop the other half. Finely chop the dill and the mint leaves. Mince or grate the garlic. Halve the zucchini lengthwise, then cut into 1⁄2-inch slices. Juice the lemon. Thinly slice the lettuce and the tomato.
2. Combine the sliced red onion with half the lemon juice and set aside to marinate.
3. Toss the zucchini with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Lay them out on a baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
4. Meanwhile, season the lamb with cumin, allspice, garlic, chopped onion, half the mint, and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Thoroughly mix with your hands. Form the mixture into ping pong-sized meatballs.
5. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Sear the meatballs for about 8 minutes, until golden brown and barely pink in the center.
6. Toast the pitas in the oven for 3 minutes, until heated through.
7. Combine the yogurt with dill, remaining lemon juice and remaining mint. Thoroughly mix and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
8. Fill the pitas with lettuce, a few slices of tomato, meatballs, pickled onions, and a dollop of yogurt sauce. Serve with the roasted zucchini to the side.
