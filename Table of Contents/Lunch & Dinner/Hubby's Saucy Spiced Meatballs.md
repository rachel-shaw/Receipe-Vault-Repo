## Ingredients
**Meatball Ingredients**
- 30 g breadcrumbs
- 1 pound ground bison
- 1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped (120 g)
- ¾ cup finely chopped fresh parsley
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- extra-virgin olive oil, for frying

**Sauce Ingredients**
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, finely chopped (240 g)
- 3 red bell peppers, finely chopped (536 g)
- kosher salt, to taste
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or substitute 1.5 tsp sweet paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper)
- 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2 (14.5-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
- 2 (14.5-ounce) cans cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained (502 g)
- leaves from 2 bunches of cilantro, chopped
- 1 lemon, thinly sliced (leave peel on)
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon


## Directions
**To make the meatballs:**
1. In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, beef, onion, parsley, garlic, egg, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, curry powder, salt, black pepper, and cumin. Mix gently with your hands until combined. Measure out the mixture in ½-cup portions and roll into balls. Sprinkle with salt.
3. In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pot) over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear the meatballs all over until golden, about 5 minutes. Set aside.

**To make the sauce:**
1. Add the oil to the same pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and bell peppers and season with salt and black pepper. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. 
2. Stir in the garlic, Aleppo pepper, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, curry powder, and cumin. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook until the vegetables are soft and the spices are fragrant, about 3 minutes. 
3. Stir in 2 cups water, the tomatoes, chickpeas, cilantro, lemon, tomato paste, sugar, and cinnamon. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has thickened slightly. Check the seasoning, adding more salt if desired.
4. Place the seared meatballs in the sauce. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have intensified, 35 to 40 minutes.

**To serve:**
1. Serve as is or with fluffy basmati rice.
