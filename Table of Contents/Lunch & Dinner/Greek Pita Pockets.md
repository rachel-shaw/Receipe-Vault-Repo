This hearty meal is packed with fresh, savory Mediterranean-style flavors. You'll load juicy seasoned ground beef into warm pita pockets spread with tangy garlic-yogurt sauce and top with juicy tomato-cucumber salad and crumbled feta cheese. Serve with more salad on the side for a mouthwatering meal in a speedy 20 minutes.

## Ingredients
- 2 mini cucumbers
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 1 cup feta cheese
- 8 tbsp plain yogurt
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 4 pita bread
- 20 ounce ground beef


## Directions
1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add beef*, half the garlic powder (you’ll use the rest later), a pinch of salt, and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Carefully drain any excess grease from pan.
2. Meanwhile, wash and dry produce. Quarter cucumber lengthwise; slice into 1⁄4-inch-thick pieces. Dice tomato into 1⁄4-inch pieces.
3. In a small bowl, combine yogurt and remaining garlic powder. Taste and season with salt and pepper. • In a medium bowl, combine cucumber, tomato, feta, a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and pepper.
4.  Wrap pitas in damp paper towels; microwave until warm and pliable, 30-40 seconds. Halve pitas; gently pull apart to create pockets. TIP: Halve pitas one at a time to make opening easier and prevent them from sticking. You can also toast them for added texture! • Spread insides of each pita pocket with as much sauce as you like, then fill with beef and salad. Drizzle any remaining sauce on top. Serve with any remaining salad on the side. TIP: If you like things spicy, add a drizzle of your favorite hot sauce!
