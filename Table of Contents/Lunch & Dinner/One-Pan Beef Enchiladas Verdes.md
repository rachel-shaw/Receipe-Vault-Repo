We’re very into verde. Don’t get us wrong, we love a red salsa as much as anyone. But when it comes to these enchiladas? Team green all the way. This mild, tomatillo-based salsa adds a sweet kick to pork filling and coats tortillas with subtle tang. A zesty cheese topping turns brown and bubbly in the oven, then everything’s cooled with crema and scallion greens. But be warned: After this dinner, your entire enchilada-world may be turned upside down. Welcome to the dark (green) side!

## Ingredients
- 2 poblano pepper
- 4 scallions
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 14.12 ounce green salsa
- 1 cup Mexican cheese blend
- 12 flour tortillas


## Directions
1. Heat broiler to high. Wash and dry produce. • Halve, deseed, and thinly slice poblano crosswise into strips. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
2. In a small bowl, combine sour cream with hot sauce to taste. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until poblano is softened and lightly blistered, 5-7 minutes.
4. Add a drizzle of oil, pork*, scallion whites, and Southwest Spice to pan with poblano; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes. • Stir in 1⁄4 of the salsa (you’ll use the rest in the next step); taste and season with salt and pepper. • Turn off heat; transfer filling to a medium bowl. Wipe out pan.
5. Place a small amount of filling on one half of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to create enchiladas. Place, seam sides down, in pan used for filling. TIP: For 4 servings or if pan isn’t ovenproof, place enchiladas in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. • Top with remaining salsa and sprinkle with Mexican cheese.
6. Broil enchiladas until browned and bubbly, 3-4 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning. • Drizzle with crema and sprinkle with scallion greens. Serve.
