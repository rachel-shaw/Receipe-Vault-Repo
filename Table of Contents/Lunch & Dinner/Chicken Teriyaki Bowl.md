Forget takeout: the path to sweet-and-savory dinner bliss is as simple as breaking out a fry pan. In this recipe, chicken, pepper, and onion are coated in tantalizing teriyaki and peanuts are transformed into the perfect crunchy topping. Everything comes together over a bed of steamy white rice mixed with warm, sizzly ginger. The results? A symphony of flavors and textures that are so delicious, you might just lick the plate.

## Ingredients
- 2 thumb ginger
- 2 yellow onion
- 2 red bell peppers
- 4 scallions
- 20 ounces chicken breast strips
- 16 tbsp teriyaki sauce
- 1.5 jasmine rice
- 1 ounce peanuts
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Trim scallions; cut crosswise into 1½-inch pieces. Pat chicken dry with paper towels.
2. Melt 2 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. Add 2¼ cups water and a pinch of salt; bring to a boil. Once boiling, stir in rice, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. Meanwhile, add peanuts to a large, dry pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until toasted, 2-4 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and 1 tsp sugar. Cook, stirring, until coated, 30-60 seconds. Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl. Wipe out pan.
4. Heat a large drizzle of oil in pan used for peanuts over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add bell pepper and cook, stirring, until softened, 2-3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a medium bowl.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Return veggies to pan, stirring to combine. Add scallions and remaining ginger; cook 30-60 seconds. Reduce heat to medium low and stir in teriyaki sauce. Cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes.
6. Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper and divide between plates. Top with stir-fry. Sprinkle with peanuts. Drizzle with sriracha to taste.
