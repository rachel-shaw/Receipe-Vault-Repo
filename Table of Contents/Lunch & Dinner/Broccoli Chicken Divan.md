Chicken divan is a classic chicken casserole that layers leftover chicken with cream soup, butter, breadcrumbs, and cheese. This recipe adds broccoli to the mix, lending beautiful color and garden-fresh flavor to every bite. _Divan_ takes the name of the Divan Parisien Restaurant, where the dish was created in the early twentieth century.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound chopped fresh broccoli
- 1 ½ cups cubed, cooked chicken meat
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of broccoli soup
- ⅓ cup milk
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons dried bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Place broccoli in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
3. Place the cooked broccoli in a 9 inch pie plate. Top with the chicken. In a bowl, mix the soup and milk, and pour over the chicken. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Mix the melted butter with the bread crumbs, and sprinkle over the cheese.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 15 minutes.

## Notes
Serves 6.

Can also substitute zucchini for veggie.
