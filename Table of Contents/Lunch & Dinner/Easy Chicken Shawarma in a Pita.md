# Easy Chicken Shawarma in a Pita

![[easychickenshawaramapit.jpeg]]

The first time I made this deliriously delicious dish was back in 2020 during the height of the quarantine. All of my kids were home for an extended period of time, and I was attempting to make a new and exciting meal each day, so we could at least celebrate good food and family during these unsettling times. (Some day I hope to chronicle the 100 different meals I made in 100 consecutive days during lockdown.) I’ve come to enjoy nearly every recipe I’ve made from Eden’s Eating Out Loud cookbook, which is filled with intensely flavored Middle Eastern food. I’ll warn you, this meal, with all of its vibrant sauces, pickled red onions and chopped salad, takes time…but it’s worth every minute. Eden even includes a recipe for the pita in her book, but I haven’t made it yet so I used a favorite store-bought variety instead. Enjoy this scrumptious meal!

## Ingredients
- 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 3 to 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, grated
- 1 tablespoon [[Shawarma Spice Blend (EatingOutLoud)]]
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

**For Pita Assembly**
- 6 pitas
- 1 cup [[Garlicky Tahini]]
- [[Green Zhug]]
- Amba (recommend [purchasing](https://www.amazon.com/Amba-Mediterranean-Dressing-AUTHENTIC-Eastern/dp/B07BYGWSGT/ref=asc_df_B07BYGWSGT?mcid=8cc53120aa2e3ab491642b8a42fd7aa5&hvocijid=3094684490507682452-B07BYGWSGT-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3094684490507682452&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1014602&hvtargid=pla-2281435177618&psc=1); Trader Joe's may have it)
- 2 cups [[Chopped Salad]]
- [[Quick-Pickled Red Onion]]
- chopped fresh parsley

## Directions
1. Make the chicken: In a large bowl, combine the chicken thighs, 3 tbsps. of olive oil, the garlic, and the shawarma spice blend. Place in the fridge and marinate for at least 2 hours up to overnight. Let the chicken come to room temperature for 1 hour before cooking. Remove the chicken from the bowl, discarding the marinade, and season well with salt and pepper.
2. While allowing the chicken to marinate, make the sauces and salad recipes. 
3. Preheat a grill until hot. (Or pan-sear, heat the remaining 2 tbsps. of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.) Grill (or pan-sear) the chicken until cooked through and just crisp or lightly charred, about 5 minutes per side. Slice each thigh into strips.
4. There is a proper method to stuffing a pita, and here it is: Lay the pita on its side so that when you layer the ingredients, they are getting spread evenly—ensuring you get a taste of everything in each bite. Schmear one side of the inside of the pita with tahini, followed by zhug, a little amba, some of the salad, then the sliced chicken. Place pickled red onion on top, plus a little more salad to fill in any empty space in the pita. Finish with more tahini, zhug, amba, and some parsley.
