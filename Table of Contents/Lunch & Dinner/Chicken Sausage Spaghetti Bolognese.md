A big bowl of pasta never fails to satisfy—it’s quick, carby, comforting, and our go-to no matter the weather. When you add bites of Italian chicken sausage, tender broiled zucchini, and Parmesan to the equation, you’ve reached another level of deliciousness entirely. Ready to enjoy bite after bite of twirly spaghetti cloaked in this flavor-boosted bolognese? We thought so.

## Ingredients
- 2 zucchini
- 2 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 18 ounce Italian chicken sausage
- 12 ounce spaghetti
- 27.52 ounce crushed tomatoes
- 2 tsp chicken concentrate
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp butter
- salt and pepper


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and heat broiler to high or oven to 500 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons.
2. Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and half the Italian Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later). Broil or bake on top rack until browned and softened, 5-7 minutes. (TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning.) Remove from oven.
3. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken sausage and remaining Italian Seasoning. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until cooked through and browned, 4-6 minutes.
4. Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain and set aside.
5. Stir crushed tomatoes, stock concentrate, and 2 tsp sugar into pan with sausage. Season generously with salt (around ¾ tsp) and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced, 5-7 minutes.
6. Stir sour cream and 2 TBSP butter into pan with sauce. Add spaghetti and zucchini; toss to coat. (If your pan isn’t large enough, pour everything back into large pot.) If needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water 1 TBSP at a time until pasta is thoroughly coated in sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.
