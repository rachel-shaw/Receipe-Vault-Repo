This easy riff on the classic Korean barbecue dish adds noodles to soak up all the salty-sweet-umami-spicy flavors—a delicious way to celebrate Asian Heritage Month! Here, we sauté beef in savory-sweet bulgogi sauce infused with chili, lime, garlic, and soy. Next we add carrot, cabbage, and scallions. Taking it to next-level comfort food, we stir-fry it all with buttery ramen noodles, top it with a sprinkle of scallion greens and squeeze of lime juice, and 15 minutes later (that’s right, 15!) this lightning-quick dinner idea is served!

## Ingredients
- 2 lime
- 4 scallions
- 8 ounce bulgogi sauce
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 ounce sweet Thai chili sauce
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 8 ounce bag red cabbage and carrot mix
- 9 ounce ramen noodles
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Quarter lime. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together bulgogi sauce, soy sauce, chili sauce, garlic powder, and juice from lime. Set aside.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add beef* and season with 1 tsp salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and almost cooked through, 3-4 minutes. • Add scallion whites, cabbage and carrot mix, and a pinch of salt and pepper to pan and cook, stirring frequently, until veggies are softened and beef is cooked through, 2-3 minutes more. Stir in half the bulgogi-soy mixture (you’ll use the rest later). • Remove pan from heat; cover to keep warm.
4. Once water is boiling, add three-fourths of the noodles to pot (save the rest for another use). Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 1-2 minutes. Reserve ¼ cup noodle cooking water, then drain. Rinse noodles under cold water for 30 seconds. TIP: This stops the cooking and helps prevent sticky noodles.
5. Return pan with beef mixture to low heat. Add drained noodles and 2 TBSP butter; cook, stirring, until butter melts and noodles are evenly coated, 2 minutes. • Add remaining bulgogi-soy mixture and toss until combined and noodles are warmed through. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. TIP: If needed, stir in reserved noodle cooking water, a splash at a time, until noodles are coated.
6. Divide noodle stir-fry between bowls and top with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.

## Notes
Serves 4.

*Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.
