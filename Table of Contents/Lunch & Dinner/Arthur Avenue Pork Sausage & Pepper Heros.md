In Philly, they call it “hoagie.” In New England, it’s a “grinder.” And all across the country, they call it a “sub”… but fuggedabout calling it anything but a “hero” in New York! For these Little-Italy-inspired sandwiches, our chefs have pulled out all the stops. Mini baguette loaves are split open and slathered with garlic butter, then toasted until crispy and golden. They’re stuffed with flavorful crumbled pork sausage and tender, sautéed peppers and onions, then blanketed with mozzarella and baked again to ooey-gooey perfection. Not all heroes wear capes, friends.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce yukon gold potatoes
- 2 long green peppers
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 18 ounce pork sausage
- 3 ounce tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 4 demi-baguettes
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese
- 4 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper into strips. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Place 4 TBSP butter in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until just softened, 10-15 seconds. Stir in ½ tsp garlic powder and a pinch of salt. (You’ll use the remaining garlic powder in the next step.)
2. Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, remaining garlic powder, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until browned and crispy, 20-25 minutes.
3. While potatoes roast, heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper, sliced onion, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 5-7 minutes. TIP: Add splashes of water as needed to prevent veggies from burning. • Transfer to a plate.
4. Meanwhile, remove sausage from casing; discard casing. • Heat a drizzle of olive oil in pan used for veggies over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.
5. Stir tomato paste, 1 cup water, and Italian Seasoning into pan with sausage. Cook, stirring, until sauce is bubbling, 1-2 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. When potatoes have about 5 minutes left, halve baguettes lengthwise, stopping before you get all the way through. Spread cut sides with garlic butter. Place cut sides up on a second baking sheet. TIP: Line sheet with foil first for easier cleanup. Toast on middle rack until bread is golden, 3-4 minutes. • Carefully spoon sausage mixture onto bottom halves; top with veggies and mozzarella. TIP: The sandwiches are supposed to be messy—don’t be afraid to pile them high! • Return to middle rack until cheese melts, 2-3 minutes more.
7. Close heroes, pressing down to secure. Divide between plates. Serve with potato wedges on the side.
