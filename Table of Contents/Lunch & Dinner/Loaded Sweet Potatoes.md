## Ingredients
**ingredients for Entree**
- 560g steak
- 4 small sweet potatoes
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp garlic
- 1/2 cup diced onion
- 3 cups broccoli
- Montreal seasoning (or dried thyme + pepper)
- green onion or cilantro for garnish

**Ingredients for Sauce**
- 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1/3 cup water
- 2 tbsp cornstarch

## Directions
1. Set oven to 400F.  Poke a fee holes in a sweet potato using a fork.  Wrap it in foil and place on a baking tray.  Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the potato can easily be pierced with a fork.
2. Set a nonstick skillet on medium heat.  Once hot, add oil, garlic and onions.  Caramelize the onions until the edges turn brown and translucent, about 3 minutes.
3. Increase the heat to medium-high, then toss in the flank steak pieces.  As it cooks, sprinkle in dried thyme and cracked pepper.  Continue searing the meat in the skillet, about 4 to 6 minutes.
4. As the beef sears, in a small bowl mix together the ingredients for the sauce.
5. Reduce the heat to medium, fold in the broccoli florets with the beef, then make a hole in the middle of the skillet.  Pour in the sauce and bring it to a light simmer.  As soon as the sauce begins to bubble, begin to stir in the skillet so the sauce doesn’t clump or get slimy.
6. Remove the skillet from the heat to allow the sauce to continue to thicken and continue stirring.
7. Slice up on the baked sweet potatoes and evenly divide the beef & broccoli among the potatoes.  Garnish and enjoy!
