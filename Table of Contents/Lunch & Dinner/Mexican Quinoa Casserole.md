5. To the quinoa mixture, add black beans, 1/2 cup cilantro, 1/4 cup green onions, and olives.
6. Combine all ingredients.
7. Transfer mixture to the baking dish, top with cheese and bake for 30 minutes, uncovered. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with remaining cilantro and green onions, and serve warm with tortilla chips.
