No matter which way you try to dress it up, a meatloaf is all about the meat. Which is why we’re adding little more than a few breadcrumbs to keep it moist and a smattering of balsamic ketchup glaze to keep things interesting. That’s all you really need (along with some green beans and mashed sweet potato) to emphasize the classic timelessness of this HelloFresh Hall of Fame recipe.

## Ingredients
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/4 ounce parsley
- 1 yellow onion
- 5 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 4 tbsp ketchup
- 1/2 panko breadcrumbs
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 4 sweet potatoes
- 12 ounce green beans
- 1 ounce honey
- 1 ounce almonds
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mince or grate 1 clove garlic (we sent more). Chop parsley. Halve and peel onion. Using the large holes of a grater, grate one onion half into a large bowl (use the other as you like). In a separate small bowl, mix 1 TBSP vinegar and ketchup.
2. Add garlic, parsley, panko, beef, and ½ tsp salt to bowl with onion. Season with pepper, then mix with hands to combine. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Brush ketchup mixture onto meatloaves. Roast in oven until cooked through, about 25 minutes total (we’ll check on them after 10 minutes).
3. Roast meatloaves in oven until cooked through, about 25 minutes total (we’ll check on them after 10 minutes). Meanwhile, peel sweet potatoes, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Place in a medium pot with a pinch of salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
4. After meatloaves have baked 10 minutes, remove baking sheet from oven. Toss green beans on same sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. (TIP: Use tongs to avoid burns.) Return to oven and roast until meatloaves are cooked through and green beans are tender and lightly crisped, about 15 minutes more.
5. Drain sweet potatoes and return to pot. Mash in pot with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. (TIP: If potatoes have cooled, quickly reheat over medium-low heat.) Add 1 TBSP butter and honey. Continue mashing to melt butter and combine. Season generously with salt and pepper.
6. When meatloaves and green beans are done, sprinkle almonds over green beans and toss to combine. Divide meatloaves between plates and serve with sweet potato mash and green beans on the side.
