Hummus and pita chips go together like...well, hummus and pita chips! Still, we firmly believe that hummus is destined for bigger and better things. Case in point: this delicious, layered bowl. It starts with a base of hummus, then it’s piled with chewy Israeli couscous, za’atar-spiced chicken, lemony chopped salad, tangy feta sauce, and a sprinkle of fresh dill. This mix of vibrant, crunchy, creamy, and savory components is sure to satisfy. Beat that, chips!

## Ingredients
- 2 shallot
- 2 roma tomato
- 2 persian cucumber
- 1 lemon
- 1/4 ounce dill
- 5 ounce Israeli Couscous
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 20 ounce chicken cutlets
- 1 tbsp [[Zaatar Spice Blend]]
- 1 cup feta cheese
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 8 tbsp hummus
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Halve, peel, and thinly slice half the shallot; mince remaining. Fill a small bowl with cold water; add sliced shallot and soak. (This helps mellow its sharp bite!) • Dice tomato. Trim and dice cucumber. Zest and quarter lemon. Pick and finely chop fronds from dill.
2. Drain sliced shallot and place in a medium bowl. Toss with tomato, cucumber, juice from two lemon wedges, 1 TBSP chopped dill (2 TBSP for 4 servings), and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add minced shallot; cook, stirring, until softened, 1-2 minutes. • Add couscous and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until couscous is lightly toasted, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in 3⁄4 cup water (11⁄2 cups for 4 servings) and stock concentrate. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer and cover. Cook until couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. Drain any excess liquid if necessary. Taste and season with salt and pepper. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
4. Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with 1⁄2 tsp Za’atar Spice (1 tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. (Be sure to measure the Za’atar Spice—we sent more.) • Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. TIP: Work in batches if necessary. • Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a cutting board. Once cool enough to handle, thinly slice crosswise.
5. While chicken cooks, in a second small bowl, combine feta, sour cream, and lemon zest to taste; mash with a fork to combine. (TIP: If the feta is cold, massage in package first to soften.) Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. (It’s OK if the sauce isn’t completely smooth.)
6. Spread hummus on one side of each serving bowl. Fluff couscous with a fork; divide between bowls next to hummus. Top couscous with chicken. Top hummus with salad (draining first). Drizzle everything with feta sauce. Garnish with remaining chopped dill if desired. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
