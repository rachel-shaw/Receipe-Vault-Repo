The pan sauce on tonight’s pork is sweeeet (and spicy). Our chefs combined sweet Thai chili sauce with ponzu, shallot, lime, and butter—a winning combination drizzled atop juicy pork filets. You’ll whip up a pot of fluffy zesty rice and pair with crisp roasted broccoli on the side for a restaurant-worthy meal.

## Ingredients
- 2 shallots
- 2 limes
- 1/2 ounce cilantro
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 20 ounces chicken cutlets
- 2 broccoli bunches
- 2 ounces sweet Thai chili sauce
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 12 mL Ponzu sauce
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if necessary. Halve, peel, and mince shallot. Zest and quarter lime. Roughly chop cilantro.
2.  In a small pot, combine rice, 1 1/2 cup water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. While rice cooks, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and sear, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 4-6 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in the next step). Remove pan from heat. Transfer pork to one side of a baking sheet.
4. Toss broccoli on opposite side of sheet from pork with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until pork is cooked through and broccoli is browned and tender, 10-12 minutes. Once pork is done, transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes. **Season broccoli and spread across entire sheet; roast as instructed.**
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for pork over medium-high heat. Add shallot; cook until softened and slightly browned, 1-2 minutes. Stir in stock concentrate, chili sauce, ponzu, and 1/3 cup water. Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, 2-3 minutes. Stir in a big squeeze of lime juice to taste. Remove pan from heat; stir in 2 TBSP butter until melted.
6. Thinly slice pork crosswise. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and half the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice, broccoli, and pork between plates. Top pork with pan sauce. Garnish everything with remaining cilantro. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.
