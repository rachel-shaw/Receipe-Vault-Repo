Peanut butter and jelly. Apples with peanut butter. Chocolate in peanut butter cups. There are some nutty pairings that just seem to work perfectly together. Pork and peanut butter may seem like an unlikely combo, but it steals the show tonight: Ground pork is simmered in a sweet and spicy peanut sauce, then draped over ramen noodles. That’s all garnished with scallions, chili flakes, and even more peanuts. We’d never call you nutty for licking this bowl clean.

## Ingredients
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 scallions
- 6 ounce carrots
- 1 ounce peanuts
- 8 tbsp sweet soy glaze
- 2 tsp pork ramen stock concentrate
- 2 tbsp szechuan paste
- 5 tsp white wine vinegar
- 1.15 ounce peanut butter
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 20 ounce ground pork
- 9 ounce ramen noodles
- 3 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Peel and mince garlic. Trim and cut scallions crosswise into 1-inch pieces; thinly slice one-quarter of the scallion greens. Trim and peel carrot; grate on the largest holes of a box grater. Roughly chop peanuts.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together sweet soy glaze, stock concentrate, Szechuan paste, vinegar, peanut butter, 3 tsp sugar, 1⁄3 cup water, and chili flakes to taste until smooth.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork. Using a spatula, press into an even layer. Cook, undisturbed, until browned on bottom, 3-4 minutes. • Break up meat into pieces and continue cooking until pork is cooked through, 2-4 minutes more.
4. Add garlic and scallion pieces to pan with pork; cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. • Stir in sauce; cook until reduced and thickened slightly, 1-2 minutes.
5. Once water is boiling, add noodles to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 1-2 minutes. Drain and thoroughly rinse under cold water, at least 30 seconds. (This stops cooking and helps prevent sticky noodles.) • Add drained noodles, carrot, and 2 TBSP butter to pan with pork mixture. Toss until noodles are warmed through and everything is thoroughly combined, 1-2 minutes. (TIP: If needed, stir in water a splash at a time until noodles are thoroughly coated in sauce.) Taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. Divide stir-fry between bowls. Top with sliced scallion greens, peanuts, and remaining chili flakes to taste. Serve.
