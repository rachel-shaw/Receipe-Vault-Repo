One of our favorite cheffy tricks for taking meatballs from ordinary to extraordinary? Just add a flavorful glaze! Here, we blend scallions and ginger into ground beef, then form into meatballs and roast until tender. While they’re still hot from the oven, we toss them in a blend of soy glaze and chili sauce for spicy, sweet, and savory notes. They’re served over a stir-fry of tender bell pepper, carrots, green beans, and citrusy ponzu sauce, then sprinkled with sesame seeds for nutty crunch.

## Ingredients
- 2 scallions
- 2 thumbs ginger
- 2 bell peppers
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1/2 panko breadcrumbs
- 12 ounce green beans
- 8 ounce shredded carrots
- 24 mL Ponzu sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 8 tbsp sweet soy glaze
- 2 ounce sweet Thai chili sauce
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Trim green beans if necessary. Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips.
2. In a large bowl, combine beef*, panko, scallion whites, half the ginger, 1½ tsp salt, and pepper. • Form mixture into 20-24 1½-inch meatballs. Spread out on a baking sheet. • Bake on top rack until meatballs are browned and cooked through, 14-16 minutes.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green beans and cook until slightly softened and lightly browned, 3-4 minutes. • Stir in bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are browned and tender, 4-5 minutes more. • Add carrots; cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 1-2 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper.
4. Add ponzu, half the sesame seeds (save the rest for serving), remaining ginger, and 2 TBSP butter to pan with veggies. Cook, stirring, until ginger is fragrant and butter has melted, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. • Remove pan from heat; keep covered until ready to serve.
5. In a second large microwave-safe bowl, combine sweet soy glaze with chili sauce; microwave until just warmed through, 30 seconds. • Once meatballs are fully cooked, carefully add to bowl and toss with sauce to coat.
6. Divide veggie stir-fry between plates or shallow bowls; top with meatballs and any remaining sauce. Sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining sesame seeds. Serve.
