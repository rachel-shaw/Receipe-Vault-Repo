Tender pasta pillows are good in any form, but they’re _especially_ good when packed with sweet butternut squash purée. Add tender strips of roasted bell pepper and a cheesy garlic cream sauce to the mix and you’ve got yourself a winning dinner. Luckily, this elegant pasta is as easy to make as it is delicious. All you need is 35 minutes for this dish to hit your table.

## Ingredients
- 2 bell peppers
- 4 scallions
- 4 garlic cloves
- 18 ounce butternut squash agnolotti
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tbsp cream cheese
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Halve bell pepper; remove seeds and stems. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
2. Drizzle bell pepper halves with olive oil, salt, and pepper; arrange cut sides down on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Place garlic cloves in the center of a small piece of foil; drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cinch into a packet and place on same sheet. Roast until bell pepper is lightly charred and garlic is softened, 20-25 minutes.
3. Once bell pepper has roasted for 15 minutes, add agnolotti to pot of boiling water; reduce to a simmer. Cook until al dente and floating to the top, 3-5 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain and set aside.
4. Transfer roasted bell pepper and garlic cloves to a cutting board. Thinly slice bell pepper and gently mash garlic with a fork.
5. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in pot used for agnolotti over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add ⅓ cup reserved pasta cooking water, stock concentrate, cream cheese, sour cream, half the Parmesan, and 2 TBSP butter; stir until smooth. Stir in sliced bell pepper and mashed garlic. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce is slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Stir agnolotti into sauce. If sauce seems dry, add a splash or two more of reserved pasta cooking water. Divide between bowls. Garnish with scallion greens, pepper, and remaining Parmesan.
