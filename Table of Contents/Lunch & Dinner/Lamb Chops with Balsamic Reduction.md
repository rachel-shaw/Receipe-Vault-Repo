This balsamic-sauced lamb chop recipe is a favorite in my house. Rosemary and thyme give it great flavor. It serves four people, but if you like two chops each as we do, you'll want to double the recipe. And if you do, just remember that the sauce will take longer to reduce.

## Ingredients
- ¾ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 lamb chops (3/4 inch thick)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¼ cup minced shallots
 - ⅓ cup aged balsamic vinegar   
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon butter


## Directions
1. Gather all ingredients.
2. Mix rosemary, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; rub onto chops, coating both sides. Place chops onto a plate, cover, and let sit for 15 minutes.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chops in the hot skillet until no longer pink in the center, about 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm.
4. Add shallots to the skillet; cook and stir until just browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour vinegar into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add broth; cook and stir until sauce has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
5. Remove sauce from the heat and stir in butter until melted.
6. Serve over chops. Enjoy!
