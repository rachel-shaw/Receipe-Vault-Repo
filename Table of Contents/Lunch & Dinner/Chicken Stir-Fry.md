Nourish 'Heart Healthy Meals' Handout

## Ingredients
**Ingredients for Entree**
- 560 g shredded chicken
- 1 head broccoli, chopped
- 2 bell peppers (any color)
- 2-3 whole carrots, sliced
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- cooked rice

**Ingredients for Sauce**
- ⅔ cup low-sodium soy sauce, or to taste
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon red chili flakes


## Directions
1. Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside (if using cooked shredded chicken, no need to set aside.)
3. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.
