Tonight, we’ve got a meal that’ll leave you feeling totally zen. This “Buddha bowl” is a one-bowl veggie meal that won’t disappoint. Here, hoisin-and-sesame-glazed sweet potatoes and mushrooms, roasted bell pepper, spicy soy mayo, and a scattering of sesame seeds are all served over a heap of fluffy, gingery rice. You’re one bite away from inner dinner peace.

## Ingredients
- 2 scallions
- 2 thumb ginger
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 16 ounce cremini mushrooms
- 2 bell peppers
- 1.5 jasmine rice
- 4 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 ounce sweet Thai chili sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Dice sweet potato into ½-inch pieces. Trim and quarter mushrooms (skip if your mushrooms are pre-sliced!). Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into ½-inch pieces.
2.  Melt 2 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and 2 TBSP ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. • Stir in rice, 2¼ cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss sweet potato and mushrooms with a drizzle of oil, half the hoisin (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. Spread out on one side of a baking sheet. Toss bell pepper on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Use 2 sheets; roast sweet potatoes and mushrooms on top rack and bell peppers on middle rack. Roast on top rack until veggies are just tender, about 15 minutes (they’ll finish cooking in Step 5).
4. While veggies roast, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, soy sauce, and as much chili sauce as you like. TIP: Start with half the chili sauce, then taste and add more from there if you like things spicy.
5. Once veggies have roasted 15 minutes, remove sheet with sweet potatoes and mushrooms; leave bell peppers roasting. Using a spatula, carefully toss sweet potato and mushrooms with remaining hoisin and half the sesame seeds (save the rest for serving). Return to oven until veggies are tender and glaze is tacky, 5-8 minutes more.
6. Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt; divide between bowls. Arrange sweet potato and mushrooms and bell pepper over rice in separate sections. Drizzle everything with as much chili soy mayo as you like. Top with scallion greens and remaining sesame seeds. Serve.
