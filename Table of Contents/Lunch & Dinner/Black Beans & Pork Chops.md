This recipe for pork chops with beans makes a hearty dinner, especially served with rice too. It is one of my family's favorite dinners given to me by my sister. You may adjust the amounts of beans and salsa to your preference. I always seem to add more!

## Ingredients
- 4 bone-in pork chops
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, with liquid
- 1 cup salsa
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro


## Directions
1. Season pork chops with pepper.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
3. Pour beans and salsa over pork chops and season with cilantro. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and simmer until pork chops are cooked no longer pink in the center, 20 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

## Notes
Can also add corn.

Serves 4.
