This dish takes its name from the Korean word for mixing rice. Which is exactly what you’re meant to do after serving it: Put your rice in a bowl, add the toppings, and mix it all together so that those flavors and textures combine in a glorious mishmash. There are plenty of flavors and textures going on here, too, like sweet carrot, tender zucchini, and pork tossed with garlic, ginger, and soy sauce.
