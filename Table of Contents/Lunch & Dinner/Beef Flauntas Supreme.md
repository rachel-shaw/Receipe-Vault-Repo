Don’t get us wrong, we enjoy a traditional taco—but when we’re in the mood to mix things up, we love flautas (aka rolled-up tacos with a crispy outer shell). Here, we achieve the signature flauta crunch factor by baking the stuffed tortillas (full of zesty beef and Mexican cheese) for perfectly golden results—no messy deep-frying required. That crispy crust is the perfect canvas for some of our favorite toppings: pico de gallo and lime crema. Yes, you really can have it all.

## Ingredients
- 1 yellow onion
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 2 tbsp tex-mex paste
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 12 flour tortillas
- 1 cup Mexican cheese blend
- 1 lime
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 6 tbsp sour cream


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and brush with oil (or coat with nonstick spray). Wash and dry produce. • Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP.
2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion; cook for 3 minutes. • Add beef* and Southwest Spice Blend; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and onion is softened, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in Tex-Mex paste and 1⁄2 cup water. Simmer until mixture has thickened and beef is cooked through, 2-4 minutes more. Turn off heat.
3. Meanwhile, drizzle tortillas with 2 TBSP olive oil; brush or rub to completely coat on both sides. • Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Once beef filling is done, add a heaping 1⁄4 cup filling to one side of each tortilla, then sprinkle each with 1 TBSP Mexican cheese blend. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to create flautas. Place, seam sides down, on prepared sheet. TIP: Make sure the flautas are snug on the sheet—this will prevent them from unrolling. • Bake on middle rack until golden brown and crispy, 8-12 minutes.
4. While flautas bake, finely dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt. • In a separate small bowl, combine sour cream, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt. • Divide flautas between plates. Top with pico de gallo and lime crema. Serve.
