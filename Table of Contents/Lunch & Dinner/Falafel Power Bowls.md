Get ready for dinner in a flash! This Mediterranean-inspired, plant-based meal is full of flavor, simple to make, and will be on your table in 15 minutes or less. You’ll shallow-fry falafel—spiced chickpea croquettes—to a crispy finish and serve over a bed of spinach with juicy tomatoes, briny feta, fresh dill, and earthy hummus. Finish with a sprinkle of almonds for extra flavor and crunch. Fluffy, garlicky pita completes this speedy, savory meal.

## Ingredients
- 4 tbsp garlic herb butter
- 2 mini cucumbers
- 1/2 ounce dill
- 3 ounce Greek vinaigrette
- 20 pre-made falafels
- 4 pita bread
- 10 ounce baby spinach
- 8 ounce grape tomatoes
- 1 cup feta cheese
- 8 tbsp hummus
- 1 ounce sliced almonds


## Directions
1. Drop garlic herb butter (in packet) into a glass of warm water to soften. Wash and dry produce. Thinly slice cucumber. Chop dill fronds.
2. Halve each falafel. Add a large drizzle of oil to a hot pan. Cook falafel until golden, 2-3 minutes per side. 
3. Toast pitas. Spread with garlic herb butter. Cut into wedges. • In a bowl, toss spinach with vinaigrette.
4. Divide spinach between bowls. Top with cucumber, dill, falafel, tomatoes, cheese, hummus, and almonds. Serve with garlicky pita.
