Bowls are way past “having a moment”—they’ve become a pillar of our lunches and dinners. Why? It’s simple: Everything’s better in a bowl! (Nice knowing you, plates.) But seriously, the customizable combo of carbs, protein, veggies, and a drizzle of delicious sauce cannot be denied. True to form, this rendition is fully-loaded. Buttery, lime-laced jasmine rice is topped with saucy ground pork and tender carrots. It’s all drizzled with a delectable Sriracha mayo, then topped with crispy fried onions and fresh cilantro. One bite will have you totally bowled over.

## Ingredients
- 1.5 cup jasmine rice
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 8 ounce shredded carrots
- 8 tbsp sweet soy glaze
- 3 ounce sesame dressing
- 2 scoops crispy fried onions
- 1/2 cilantro
- 1 lime
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. In a small pot, combine rice, 2 1⁄4 cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
2. While rice cooks, wash and dry produce. • Zest and quarter lime. Roughly chop cilantro. • In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise with Sriracha to taste.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork* and a big pinch of salt. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3-4 minutes. • Stir in carrots, sesame dressing, 5 TBSP sweet soy glaze, and 1 tsp sugar. Cook until carrots are softened, pork is cooked through, and sauce has thickened, 2-4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
4. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and 2 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between bowls; top with pork mixture and any remaining sauce from pan. Drizzle with Sriracha mayo. Sprinkle with crispy fried onions and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side.
