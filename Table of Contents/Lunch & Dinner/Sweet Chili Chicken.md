## Ingredients
- 2 limes
- 1 thumb ginger
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 chili pepper
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 12 ounces green beans
- 20 ounces chicken cutlets
- 6 tsp honey
- 1 tsp sriracha
- 4 tbsp butter
- 2 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Adjust rack to upper position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Zest 1 tsp zest from lime, then cut into quarters. Peel ginger, then mince or grate until you have 1 TBSP (save the rest for another use). Mince or grate garlic. Thinly slice chili, removing ribs and seeds for less heat.
2. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger and half the garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add rice, ¾ cup water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and lower heat to a gentle simmer. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Keep covered.
3. Meanwhile, toss green beans with a drizzle of olive oil and a big pinch of salt and pepper on a baking sheet. Roast until browned and tender, about 15 minutes. Once done, remove from oven and toss with half the lime zest.
4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Pat chicken dry with a paper towel and season all over with salt and pepper. Add to pan and cook until browned and no longer pink throughout, 3-5 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside. Let pan cool slightly.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for chicken over medium-low heat. Add remaining ginger and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in honey, sriracha, juice from one lime quarter, 1 TBSP water, and 1 tsp sugar. Scrape up any browned bits on bottom of pan. Let simmer until thick and sticky, 1-2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in 1 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Return chicken to pan, flipping to coat in glaze. Fluff rice with a fork, then stir in 1 TBSP butter, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice and green beans between plates. Arrange chicken on top of rice, drizzling over any glaze in pan. Garnish with chili to taste. Serve with remaining lime quarters.
