There are a lot of burger recipes out there, we know. But we like to think that this is the burger that tops all burgers, thanks to oozy, melty Monterey Jack cheese and jammy balsamic onions. Oh, and we should mention that this patty comes with breaded zucchini on the side, so you can get your fix of crispy, crunchy finger foods and a dose of veg all in one.

## Ingredients
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red onion
- 2 zucchini
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 10 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese
- 4 potato buns
- 4 tbsp ketchup
- 2 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Mince or grate 2 clove garlic. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Cut zucchini into 3-inch-long pieces, then halve each piece lengthwise. Cut halves into thin wedges.
2. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise and as much garlic as you like (start with a pinch, then taste and add more from there if desired). Season with salt and pepper.
3. \Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. (TIP: If onion starts to brown too quickly, add a splash of water.) Stir in vinegar and 2 tsp sugar. Continue cooking until caramelized and jammy, 2-3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat; transfer to a second small bowl. Wash out pan.
4. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss zucchini with 1 TBSP garlic mayo until wedges are evenly coated. Add panko, oregano, and a big pinch of salt and pepper; toss so crumbs stick to zucchini. (It’s okay if not all the breadcrumbs stick.) Spread out on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake, tossing halfway through, until panko is golden brown, 14-16 minutes.
5. Shape beef into four equal-sized patties; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used to cook onion over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook almost to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. Top each patty with Monterey Jack. Cover pan to melt cheese and allow patties to finish cooking, 1-2 minutes.
6. Halve buns and toast until golden. Spread toasted buns with ketchup and garlic mayo to taste. Fill each with a patty and as much onion jam as you like. Serve with zucchini on the side.
