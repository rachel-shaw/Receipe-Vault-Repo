A big bowl of stew is a comforting, craveable meal no matter the weather (or night of the week). Tonight’s light but nourishing meal is chock-full of goodness, with chunks of carrots, slices of tender zucchini, savory onion, and sautéed chicken all simmered together in a garlicky Tunisian-spiced tomato broth and showered with herbaceous fresh parsley. Get ready to spoon up this hearty, flavorful stew that’s as satisfying as it is delicious.

## Ingredients
- 2 zucchini
- 12 ounce carrots
- 2 yellow onions
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/2 ounce parsley
- 20 ounce chicken breast strips
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tbsp [[Tunisian Spice Blend]]
- 28 ounces diced tomatoes
- 4 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1/2 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. Peel, trim, and halve carrots lengthwise; thinly slice into ¼-inch-thick half-moons. Halve, peel, and finely dice onion. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick half-moons. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Roughly chop parsley.
2. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion, a large pinch of salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 4-6 minutes. 
3. Add a drizzle of oil to pot. Add chicken, zucchini, Tunisian Spice Blend, cumin, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and veggies are tender, 4-6 minutes more.
4. Stir garlic into pot with chicken and veggies. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. 
5. Stir in diced tomatoes, stock concentrates, 4½ cups water and ½ tsp sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer until flavors meld and stew is slightly reduced, 6-8 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.
6. Divide stew between bowls. Garnish with parsley and serve.
