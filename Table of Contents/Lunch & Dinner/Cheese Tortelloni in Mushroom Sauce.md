Umami is defined as that hard-to-describe flavor that makes it impossible to put down your fork. Not sure if you’ve ever experienced the ‘fifth taste?’ After one bite of this dish, you’ll totally understand the obsession. Tender cheese-stuffed tortelloni is tossed in a creamy sauce that’s dotted with bites of earthy mushrooms. The finishing touch is a scattering of crunchy scallion greens, plus chili flakes for a kick. Talk about savory bliss. Plus, it cooks up in no time. What are you waiting for?!

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 16 ounces button mushrooms
- 4 garlic cloves
- 18 ounces cheese tortelloni
- 2 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 4 tbsp cream cheese
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp mushroom stock concentrate
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 4 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Trim and quarter mushrooms. Mince or grate garlic.
2. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 7-9 minutes. TIP: If pan seems dry, add another drizzle of olive oil.
3. Once water is boiling, add tortelloni to pot. Reduce to a low simmer and cook until tender and floating to the top, 3-5 minutes. Turn off heat, leaving tortelloni in water.
4. Add garlic, scallion whites, half the Italian Seasoning (we’ll use the rest later), and 2 TBSP butter to pan with mushrooms. Continue to cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until scallion whites are softened and butter has melted, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.
5. Stir cream cheese, sour cream, stock concentrate, ⅓ cup pasta cooking water, and 2 TBSP butter into pan until thoroughly combined. Using a slotted spoon, gently transfer tortelloni to pan. (TIP: If needed, stir in more cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.) Gently stir to coat. Season with remaining Italian Seasoning, salt, and pepper.
6. Divide pasta between bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan, scallion greens, and chili flakes if desired.
