Salisbury steak with a savory onion sauce. This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook but tastes like it took hours to make! I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- 1 large egg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup water
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon mustard powder


## Directions
1. Gather all ingredients.
2. Combine ground beef, 1/3 cup condensed soup, bread crumbs, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl.
3. Shape into 6 oval patties.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add patties and brown on both sides. Drain excess fat.
5. Blend remaining soup and flour together in a small bowl until smooth; mix in ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard.
6. Pour soup mixture over patties in the skillet. Cover, and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Serve and enjoy!

## Notes
Serves 6.
