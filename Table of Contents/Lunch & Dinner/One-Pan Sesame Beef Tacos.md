Instead of going the traditional route with these tacos, we decided to mix things up with a Korean-style sesame beef filling. The mixture gets a kick from gochugaru—chili flakes traditionally used in dishes like kimchi and bulgogi. It’s an unconventional choice, perhaps, but one that won’t disappoint.

## Ingredients
- 6 radishes
- 2 persian cucumber
- 4 scallions
- 1/4 cilantro
- 10 tsp white wine vinegar
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp korean chili flakes
- 8 ounce shredded red cabbage
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 4 tsp sriracha
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 12 flour tortillas
- 4.5 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice radishes and cucumber into rounds. Trim and thinly slice scallions. Pick cilantro leaves from stems.
2. In a medium bowl, combine radishes, cucumber, vinegar, 2 tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. (Taste and add a pinch more sugar if you like a sweeter pickle.) Set aside, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.
3. In a small bowl, combine sour cream with a pinch of chili flakes (taste and add more from there if desired; save a little for steps 4 and 6). Season with salt and pepper.
4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add scallions and cabbage; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. • Add beef*, garlic powder, and 2 tsp sugar. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in sesame oil, soy sauce, half the Sriracha (save the rest for serving), and a pinch of chili flakes to taste. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and up to ½ tsp more sugar.
5. While filling cooks, wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds.
6. Divide tortillas between plates. Spread a bit of chili sour cream onto each tortilla; fill with beef filling, a bit of pickled veggies, and cilantro leaves. Add as much remaining Sriracha and chili flakes as you like. Serve with any remaining pickled veggies on the side.
