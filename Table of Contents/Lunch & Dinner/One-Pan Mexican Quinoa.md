This Mexican quinoa dish is one of those one-skillet recipes that's perfect for feeding a large family. And the kids love it! Serve it for Cinco de Mayo or any night of the week.

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium jalapeño pepper, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 cup yellow corn
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 medium avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
- 1 medium lime, juiced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro


## Directions
1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté jalapeño pepper and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Stir black beans, tomatoes, corn, quinoa, and chicken broth into the skillet. Season with pepper flakes, chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil.
3. Cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 20 minutes.
4. Add avocado, lime juice, and cilantro; stir until combined.

## Notes
For a little more heat, stir in 1 tablespoon of Sriracha sauce. For a vegetarian dish, use vegetable stock instead of chicken.

Also good with tortilla chips as a snack or appetizer.

Serves 4.
