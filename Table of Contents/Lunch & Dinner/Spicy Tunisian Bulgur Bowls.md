![[spicy-tunisian-bulgur-bowls.jpeg]]

Tired of blowing a whole paycheck on expensive grain bowls? Us, too! That’s why we created a bowl that feels restaurant-level but won’t break the bank. We made sure to load it up with lots of veggies and exciting flavors: sweet and spicy harissa-roasted carrots, zucchini and tomatoes seasoned with an aromatic blend of caraway, smoked paprika, and turmeric. Don’t be surprised if you unearth some pistachios and dried apricots along the way. And, of course, you can’t forget the sauces—there are two!— a bright, herbaceous chermoula and a cooling creamy lemon sauce.

## Ingredients
- 18 ounce carrots
- 1 tbsp harissa powder
- 1 cup bulgur wheat
- 4 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 ounce cilantro
- 1 lemon
- 2 zucchini
- 8 ounce grape tomatoes
- 1 ounce pistachios
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 1 tbsp [[Tunisian Spice Blend]]
- 2 ounce dried apricots
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots into sticks (like fries; ours were 3 inches long and 1⁄3 inch thick). Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, ½ tsp harissa powder, salt, and pepper. TIP: For easy cleanup, line your baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. • Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, 15-20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a small pot, combine bulgur, stock concentrates, half the garlic powder, 2 cup water, a big pinch of salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until water has absorbed and bulgur is tender, 12-15 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. While bulgur cooks, finely chop cilantro. Zest and quarter lemon. Trim and quarter zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Halve grape tomatoes crosswise. Roughly chop pistachios.
4. In a small bowl, combine cilantro, 3 TBSP olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, chili flakes to taste, and as much remaining garlic powder as you like. Season with salt and pepper. • In a separate small bowl, combine sour cream and a big pinch of lemon zest. Add water 1 tsp at a time until sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; cook, stirring, until slightly softened and lightly browned, 6-8 minutes. Add tomatoes, the Tunisian Spice, and a pinch of salt; cook until tomatoes are slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
6. Drain any excess water from bulgur if necessary; fluff with a fork. Stir in apricots and 2 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. • Divide bulgur between bowls and top with carrots, zucchini, tomatoes, and pistachios. Drizzle with chermoula and creamy lemon sauce. Sprinkle with any remaining chili flakes to taste. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
