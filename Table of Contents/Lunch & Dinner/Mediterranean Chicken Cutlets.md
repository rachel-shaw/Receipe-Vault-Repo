Looking for a different type of chicken dinner? That’s easy as 1-2-3. 1) Season chicken cutlets with our signature Mediterranean Spice Blend and cook until golden. Two: Spike sour cream with lemon zest and harissa (a paste made from chili peppers, paprika, and olive oil). Three: Stir sweet, tender carrots and scallions into lemony couscous. Garnish, serve, and presto! Chicken with a new twist.

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 1 lemon
- 20 ounces chicken cutlets
- 1 tbsp [[Mediterranean Spice Blend]]
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1 cup couscous
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 1 tsp harissa powder
- 8 ounces shredded carrots
- 4 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lemon.
2. Pat chicken dry with a paper towel; season all over with salt, pepper, and half the Mediterranean Spice (use the rest as you like). Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a plate.
3. While chicken cooks, combine couscous, stock concentrate, ¾ cup water, ½ TBSP butter, and a pinch of salt in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then microwave on high until liquid is boiling, about 1 minute. Set aside, covered, until ready to serve.
4. In a small bowl, combine sour cream, lemon zest, 1 TBSP water, ¼ tsp harissa, and a pinch of salt. Taste and add more harissa if you like.
5. Heat another drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat in pan used to cook chicken. Add scallion whites and carrots. Cook, stirring, until softened, 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat. Squeeze in juice from 1 lemon wedge. Season with salt.
6. Fluff couscous with a fork. Stir in carrot mixture. Divide finished couscous between bowls. Top with chicken. Drizzle with crema. Garnish with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over.
