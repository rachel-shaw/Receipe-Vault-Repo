Want your favorite street cart foods without having to track down your fave truck? Our chefs dreamed up just the thing: these turkey street cart-style rice bowls. Each bowl is packed with layers of flavor: buttery turmeric rice with crunchy almonds and scallions, shawarma spiced ground turkey, fresh diced tomato, and not one but TWO sauces. We’re talking classic white sauce and hot sauce. All of that’s served with warmed pita bread. Now all that’s left to do is perfect your dipping technique for the optimal saucy and flavor-packed bite.

## Ingredients
- 560g ground turkey
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 2 tbsp lemon
- 2 scallions
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tbsp [[Shawarma Spice Blend (HelloFresh)]]
- 3 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 120g cooked rice (cook with turmeric above)


## Directions
1. Cook rice with turmeric. 
2. Separate scallion whites and greens.
3. In small bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic powder, lemon juice, and water until drizzling consistency. 
4. Cook scallion whites in oil until tender, add turkey, shawarma seasoning, ½ salt, and pepper (4-6 minutes). 
5. Add stock concentrates and ½ cup water, reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened 1-2 minutes. 
6. Add half of scallion greens to cooked rice and fluff. 
7. Eat veggies and meat on top of rice, drizzle sauce on top.

## Notes
