Bowls are way past “having a moment.” They’ve become a pillar of our lunches and dinners. Why? It’s simple: everything’s better in a bowl! (Nice knowing you, plates.) But seriously, the customizable combo of carbs, protein, veggies, and a drizzle of delicious sauce cannot be denied. True to form, this Tex-Mex rendition is fully loaded. Steamy rice is topped with saucy spiced ground pork, charred green pepper and onion, salsa fresca, and smoky red pepper crema. Who needs the tortilla when you’ve got all that?

## Ingredients
- 1 cup white rice
- 2 onions
- 2 long green peppers
- 20 ounce ground pork
- 2 tbsp tex-mex paste
- 2 tomatoes
- 5 tsp white wine vinegar
- 2 scallions
- 4 tbsp smoky red pepper crema (sour cream + smoked paprika + salt)


## Directions
1. In a small pot, combine rice, 2 cup water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
2. While rice cooks, wash and dry produce. • Finely dice tomato. Halve, peel, and cut onion into ½-inch-thick wedges; mince one wedge until you have 2 TBSP. Core, deseed, and dice green pepper into ½-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
3. In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, and vinegar. Season with salt. Place smoky red pepper crema in a separate small bowl. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and onion wedges. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 7-9 minutes. • Transfer to a plate.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add pork, scallion whites, and a big pinch of salt. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in Tex-Mex paste and 1/3 cup water until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook until mixture is saucy and pork is cooked through, 1-2 minutes more.
6. Fluff rice with a fork. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: Stir in 2 TBSP butter for extra richness. • Divide rice between bowls and top with veggies, pork, salsa, crema, and any remaining sauce from pan. Garnish with scallion greens and serve.
