## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 lb chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- pinch of sea salt & pepper
- spray avocado oil
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1/2 cup diced white onion
- 1 1/4 cups brown rice, uncooked
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 3 cups low sodium chicken broth
- pinch of sea salt & pepper
- 2/3 cup finely chopped parsley (or more/less to taste)
- 1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro (or more/less to taste)
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (or red wine vinegar)


## Directions
1. Set a nonstick skillet on medium-high heat.  Once hot, spray with oil then add in the chicken pieces.  As the chicken sears, sprinkle in sea salt & pepper.  Sear in the skillet for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove. _Note: it is OK if the chicken is not cooked all the way since we will finish cooking it later_.
2. Reduce heat to medium, add oil to the skillet, then toss in garlic and onion and caramelize for 2 to 4 minutes.
3. Add UNCOOKED rice to the skillet, along with dried oregano and cumin, and quickly mix together, ensuring that each grain is covered in oil and seasoning. Cook for about 1 minute.
4. Pour in chicken broth, add the chicken breast pieces, and bring to a light simmer. Cover and cook until rice is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
5. Once the rice is cooked through and the majority of the liquid has been absorbed, remove from the heat and add the remaining ingredients.
6. Season to taste with sea salt & pepper. Enjoy with your favorite grilled vegetable.
