Saucy, smothered, hearty, and delicious: This enchilada bake has everything you could possibly want. You’ll make it by wrapping tortillas around a filling of poblano pepper, tomato, and beans, then coating the bundles with a healthy helping of mild green salsa and a sprinkle of Monterey Jack cheese. Put it in the oven and let it get piping hot and bubbly, and all you’ll have left to do is add a drizzle of spiced sour cream and dig in to that deliciousness.

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 2 poblano peppers
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 26.8 ounce black beans
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 12 flour tortillas
- 14.12 ounce green salsa
- 1/2 Monterey Jack cheese
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 2 chili peppers
- 20 ounce ground beef (or pork)
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 475 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Core, deseed, and dice poblano. Finely dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving liquid. Thinly slice chili.
2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and cook until just softened, 3-4 minutes.
3. Once poblano is just softened, add beef to pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: Drain any excess grease from pan if necessary.
4. Meanwhile, reserve 1 tsp Southwest Spice in a second small bowl for step 6. Once poblano is just softened, add tomato, scallion whites, half the beans, remaining Southwest Spice, 2 TBSP reserved bean liquid (you’ll use the remaining beans and more bean liquid in the next step) to pan. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and warmed through, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook through this step as instructed, leaving beef in pan with poblano.
5. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add remaining beans and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. • Add 1⁄3 cup reserved bean liquid. (You may have some bean liquid left over.) Simmer until warmed through, 1-2 minutes. • Reduce heat to low and stir in 2 TBSP butter. Turn off heat; mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. Season with plenty of salt and pepper.
6. Spread tortillas with mashed beans. Place a small amount of filling on one half of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides. Place, seam sides down, in an 9-by-13-inch baking dish or ovenproof pan. Spoon enough salsa over to generously coat (you may have some left over). Sprinkle with Monterey Jack. • Bake on top rack until salsa is bubbly and cheese melts, 3-5 minutes.
7. While enchiladas bake, add sour cream to bowl with reserved Southwest Spice. Stir in warm water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper. • Top baked enchiladas with crema, scallion greens, and as much chili as you like. Divide between plates and serve.
