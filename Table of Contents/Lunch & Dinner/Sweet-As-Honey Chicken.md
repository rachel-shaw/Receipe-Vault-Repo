We all have a soft spot for the sticky-sweet chicken that’s a staple of takeout dinners. But it’s not exactly a meal for any night of the week—until now. We’re swapping out the heavy glaze for a fresh burst of ginger and a swirl of honey and soy sauce. Served with tender snow peas on a bed of jasmine rice, it’ll give you a good reason to toss the phone number for your delivery joint.

## Ingredients
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 lime
- 8 ounce snow peas
- 1 thumb ginger
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 24 ounces chicken breasts
- 3 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 2 ounces honey


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Bring 1 cup water and a pinch of salt to a boil in a small pot. Mince garlic. Cut lime into wedges. Trim tough ends and strings from half the snow peas (use the rest as you like). Peel, then mince ginger until you have 1 TBSP.
2. Once water boils, add rice to pot. Cover and reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. Add to pan and cook until browned and no longer pink in center, 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside.
3. Reduce heat under pan to medium low and add a drizzle of oil. Toss in minced ginger and garlic and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1½ TBSP vinegar (we sent more) and let reduce until almost dry and evaporated.
4. Stir 1 TBSP soy sauce (we sent more), 2 TBSP water, stock concentrate, and honey into same pan. Let simmer until mixture thickens to a glaze-like consistency, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat, then return chicken to pan and toss to coat. Set aside until rest of meal is ready.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add snow peas and cook, tossing, until tender but still a little crisp, 3-4 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime.
6. Divide rice between plates. Top with snow peas and chicken. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over.
