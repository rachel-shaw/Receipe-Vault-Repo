Falling into a stir-fry rut with the same veggie + sauce combo each week? We’ve got you covered. This version features garlicky chopped chicken, which is simmered in a sweet, savory, and spicy blend of soy, ponzu, Thai chili sauce, and rice wine vinegar. It’s tossed with tender sautéed cabbage, then spooned over jasmine rice and garnished with crispy fried onions. The best part? It takes just 20 minutes from start to finish—now that’s what we call a winning dinner.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 2 scallions
- 2 ounce sweet Thai chili sauce
- 24 mL Ponzu sauce
- 8 tbsp sweet soy glaze
- 5 tsp rice wine vinegar
- 20 ounce chopped chicken breast
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 8 ounce red cabbage and carrot mix
- 2 scoops crispy fried onions
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • In a small pot, combine rice, 1½ cup water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
2. While rice cooks, trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. • In a small bowl, combine chili sauce, ponzu, vinegar, 5 TBSP sweet soy glaze, and 1 tsp sugar. TIP: Be sure to measure the sweet soy glaze—we sent more.
3. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook until just softened, 1 minute. 
4. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Add chicken and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Using a spatula, press into an even layer. Cook, undisturbed, until browned on bottom, 3-4 minutes. Break up meat into pieces and continue cooking until chicken is cooked through, 1-2 minutes. • Stir in sauce and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, 1 minute more. 
5. Stir red cabbage and carrot mix into pan with pork; cook until just tender, 2-3 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper. • Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter until melted. • Divide rice between bowls; top with stir-fry. Garnish with scallion greens and crispy fried onions. Serve.
