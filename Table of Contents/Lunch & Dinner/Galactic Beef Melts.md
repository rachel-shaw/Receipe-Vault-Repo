Nebula may have a tough exterior, but deep down she's secretly soft. And just like our bio-mechanical buddy, this galaxy-approved beef melt is crisp and toasty on the outside and tender and melty on the inside. The filling is made with seasoned ground beef, onion, and Dijon mustard, then loaded up with melted cheese. It’s piled into toasted baguettes along with roasted long green pepper, plus a drizzle of hot sauce for a fiery kick. Feeling blue? We have one more trick up our cybernetic sleeve: blue corn tortilla chips for a quantum asteroid-shattering crunch!

## Ingredients
- 2 long green pepper
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 tbsp [[Fry Seasoning]]
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 4 demi-baguette
- 2 tsp beef stock concentrate
- 4 tsp dijon mustard
- 1 cup Mexican cheese blend
- 3 ounce blue corn tortilla chips
- 2 tsp hot sauce


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper into strips. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.
2. Toss green pepper on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the Fry Seasoning, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-22 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until browned and softened, 5-7 minutes. • Add beef*, remaining Fry Seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.
4. Slice baguettes lengthwise, stopping before you get all the way through. Toast, cut sides up, in oven until lightly golden, 3-5 minutes.
5. Once beef is done, stir in stock concentrate, mustard, and 4 TBSP water. Top with Mexican cheese blend; cover pan until cheese melts, 1-2 minutes.
6. Fill baguettes with beef filling and roasted green pepper. Top with as much hot sauce as you like. • Divide sandwiches and tortilla chips between plates. Serve.
