![[Ribeye-Steak_burstedtomatoes.jpg]]

Rib-eye is just a sexy meat; you can't help but want to sink your teeth into it. It's rich and juicy because of all that lovely marbling, which is also why it's easy to cook - you don't have to do much to make it delicious. I take it to a whole other level with the blistered tomato topping: Mustard and coriander seeds are toasted until they're nice and golden, then their magic is infused into tomatoes that breaks down into sweet, tart oblivion. Pretty hot, right? 

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pound rib-eye steak
- kosher salt
- black pepper
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds
- 2 tsp coriander seeds
- 3 cups cherry tomatoes
- 2 tsp red wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp grapeseed oil
- [[Garlicky Tahini]], for serving (optional)


## Directions
1. Season the rib-eye generously with salt and pepper. Set aside so the meat can absorb the seasoning while you work on the tomatoes.
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-lot heat. Add the garlic, mustard seeds, and coriander seeds. Cook just until the mustard seeds start to pop, about 3 minutes. 
3. Add the tomatoes, season well with salt and pepper, give the pan a shake, and cook until the tomatoes have begun to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook until the tomatoes are blistered and soft, about 5 more minutes. Set aside.
4. In a medium heavy-bottomed ovenproof skillet, heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat. Sear the rib-eye until a nice golden crust forms, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side, 7 to 8 minutes more. Transfer the meat to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.
	- Or you can cook the rib-eye on the grill; just slather it with some olive oil first.
5. Slice against the grain and serve with the warm tomatoes on top, alongside garlicky tahini, if desired.
