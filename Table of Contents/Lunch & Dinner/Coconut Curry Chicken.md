A flavorful homemade curry for dinner can be just as easy as a grilled cheese or quick stir-fry, and this recipe is perfect proof. Chicken breast strips are seared until browned, then coated in tomato paste, chili flakes, and aromatic spices. It’s all simmered in creamy, nutty, mildly sweet coconut milk, then finished with bite-sized pieces of sautéed kale. Spoon it all over steamy basmati rice for soaking up every last drop of curry.

## Ingredients
- 560g chicken breast, shredded
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 red bell peppers, diced
- 3 oz tomato paste
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 2 coconut milk
- 1 tbsp sour cream
- 2 scallions
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp butter
- 120g cooked rice


## Directions
1. Separate scallion whites and greens. 
2. Sauté bell pepper in oil with salt and pepper until tender, about 5-7 minutes (add splash of water to help soften). 
3. After 5 minutes, add scallion whites and cook until softened. Transfer to plate and wipe out pan. 
4. Brown shredded chicken. 
5. Add tomato paste, curry powder, paprika, and chili flakes until fragrant. 
6. Stir in coconut milk, ¼ water, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 tbsp butter, and a big pinch of salt. 
7. Cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes. 
8. Add bell pepper and sour cream, stir to combine. 
9. Turn off heat. Eat over cooked rice.

## Notes
Use shredded chicken.
Serves 4.
