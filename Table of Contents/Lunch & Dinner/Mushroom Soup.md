## Ingredients
- 30g / 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 onion , chopped
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 400g / 14 oz white mushrooms (Note 1)
- 200g/ 7 oz Swiss Brown/Cremini mushroom (Note 1)
- 3 1/4 cups vegetable stock
- 1/4 tsp salt , cooking/kosher
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 3/4 cup crème fraiche or cream (any full-fat) (Note 3)


## Directions
1. **Chopping mushrooms:** Cut mushrooms into 4 slices, then dice into 3 or 4 pieces.
2. **Saute onion and garlic:** Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes until softened, but not golden.
3. **Cook mushrooms:** Add mushrooms and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Do not try to brown; they won't as the pot is too crowded but we do not need colour.
4. **Simmer 15 min:** Add vegetable stock, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium and simmer gently for 15 minutes without a lid.
5. **Cream:** Stir in cream (or crème fraiche), then simmer for another 5 minutes.
6. **Blitz:** Transfer to a blender (do in batches, if necessary). Remove the cap from the feeding hole in the blender lid (Note 5), cover the hole with a folded tea towel. Blend until completely smooth.
7. **Return to pot**, simmer for a minute or two until bubbles caused by blending largely subside and soup is hot.
8. **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil or cream, croutons and parsley or (if you're feeling a bit fancy), chervil. Don't forget [bread](https://www.recipetineats.com/category/breads/) for dunking!

## Notes
**1. Mushrooms** – I like to use a combination to balance flavor with color. Swiss Brown/Cremini mushrooms have more mushroomy flavor but make the soup browner, whereas standard white mushrooms keep the soup color paler. You could just use all of either. Even all white mushrooms is still fabulously mushroomy, and soup will be even paler!

**2. Stock** – The better the stock, the better the soup flavor! It’s really worth making [your own vegetable stock](https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-vegetable-stock), yielding very high returns for minimal effort and clean up.

Chicken stock will also work wonderfully here if you’re happy to introduce meat into the dish – [homemade stock](https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-stock-recipe/) of course is best!

**3. Creme fraiche** – Creme fraiche is a form of soured cream. It’s tastes like something in between sour cream and regular pouring cream, and is lightly tangy. It’s also thicker than pouring cream and can be dolloped. It lends a lovely subtle freshness to the soup thanks to the mild acidity. Creme fraiche can be hard to find and is somewhat pricey. Regular pouring cream is perfectly good in it’s place and no less delicious!

**5. Blending** –  Doing this allows heat to escape and prevents a hot soup explosion! If you blend hot soup with a tightly sealed it, the lid will blow off and you’ll end up with hot soup all over you and your kitchen … been there, done that!
