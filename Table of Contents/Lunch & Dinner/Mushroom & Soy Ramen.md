Our chefs are obsessed with ramen—and no, we don’t mean the microwave variety. We’re talking about that soul-stirring combination of rich miso broth, soy-ginger mushrooms, and a tangle of chewy noodles. For this veggie-centric version, each bowl is topped off with crispy onions, aromatic scallion greens, and as much (or little!) sriracha as your heart desires. If you weren’t a hopeless ramen-tic yet, this will make you one.

## Ingredients
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 scallions
- 2 thumb ginger
- 16 ounce button mushrooms
- 1 tsp sriracha
- 4 tsp veggie pho stock concentrate
- 12 ounce ramen noodles
- 4 tsp miso sauce concentrate
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 4 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 2 scoops crispy fried onions


## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince ginger. Peel and mince garlic. Trim and quarter mushrooms.
2. Once water is boiling, add ramen noodles to pot. Cook, stirring, until just softened, 1-2 minutes. • Drain and rinse noodles under cold water, then toss with a drizzle of oil. Keep empty pot handy for the next step.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in empty pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites, ginger, and half the garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Stir 6 cups water, hoisin, miso sauce concentrate, and veggie pho stock concentrate into pot with aromatics. (TIP: Taste broth and season with salt if desired.) Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. • Simmer, covered, until ready to serve.
5. While broth simmers, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, remaining garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 6-8 minutes. • Turn off heat. Add soy sauce; toss to coat.
6. Divide ramen noodles between large soup bowls. Pour broth over noodles. (You may have some noodles and broth left over—seconds!) Top each bowl with mushrooms and any remaining sauce from pan. Sprinkle with scallion greens and drizzle with sriracha to taste. Garnish with a few crispy onions and serve. TIP: Don’t add all the onions just yet! Add more as you eat to keep them crispy.
