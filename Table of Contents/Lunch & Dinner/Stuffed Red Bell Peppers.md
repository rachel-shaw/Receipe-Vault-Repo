"This is one of my favorite recipes, but I have omitted the typical rice, sour cream, and oil that goes into the usual recipe to give it a more meaty, low-carb feel. With the combo of pork, ground chuck, onions, and garlic, you don't really miss it, trust me." - Christine Teigen

## Ingredients
- 4 large red bell peppers  
- 3/4 lb. ground chuck  
- 1/2 lb. ground pork  
- 1 medium onion, chopped  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 2 tsp. beef bouillon granules  
- 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp. black pepper 
- 1/4 tsp. salt 
- Dash of seasoning salt, preferably Lawry's  
- 1 c. tomatoes, diced  
- 1 c. mushrooms, finely chopped  
- 1 c. shredded cheese (_Note:_ I use 4-Cheese Mexican pre-shredded in the bag.)  
- 1/2 c. green onion, thinly sliced  
- 1 c. hot water


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Halve the red bell peppers through the stem. Clean out the insides and seeds. 
2. In a hot skillet, sauté the beef, pork, chopped onion and garlic until just brown. Add 1 tsp. beef bouillon, garlic powder, salt, pepper and seasoning salt. Stir. Drain the fat. Add the tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese. Stir until cheese is melted and remove from heat. Set aside. 
3. Mix the hot water with the remaining bouillon. Stir and let dissolve. 
4. Fill the red pepper halves with filling. Pour water/bouillon mix into baking dish until the bottom is covered. Tightly place the filled peppers into the baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. 
5. After 35 minutes, remove cover and spoon some juice onto the meat filling. Replace cover and bake for an additional 10 minutes.

## Notes
- Can also add rice to be more filling
