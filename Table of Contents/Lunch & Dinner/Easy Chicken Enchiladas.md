Take your typical family dinner up a notch with an Easy Chicken Enchiladas recipe! Mexican cheese blend, red enchilada sauce and green chiles give these Easy Chicken Enchiladas a distinctive, mild flavor. If you like more heat, use medium or hot red enchilada sauce. This one's a sure family favorite—don't forget the toppings!

## Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 2 1/2 lb), cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, chopped (1/2 cup)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
- 1 1/2 cups sour cream
- 3/4 cup chopped roasted red bell peppers (from a jar)
- 1 can (4 oz) Old El Paso™ Chopped Green Chiles, drained
- 3 cups finely shredded Mexican cheese blend (12 oz)
- 2 cans (10 oz) Old El Paso™ Mild Red Enchilada Sauce
- 12 tortillas from 2 packages (11 oz) Old El Paso™ Flour Tortillas for Burritos (8 Count)


## Directions
1. Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) and 8-inch square (2-quart) baking dishes with cooking spray.
2. In 12-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and onion; cook and stir 4 to 5 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Stir in cumin, garlic salt and oregano. Cook 1 minute longer; drain if necessary. Pour chicken mixture into large bowl.
3. Reserve 2 tablespoons sour cream in small bowl; refrigerate. Into bowl of chicken mixture, stir remaining sour cream, roasted peppers, chiles and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese.
4. Spread heaping 3/4 cup chicken mixture on center of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas; arrange 8 seam-side down in 13x9-inch baking dish and 4 seam-side down in 8-inch baking dish.
5. Top each baking dish evenly with enchilada sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 cups cheese. Spray 2 sheets of foil with cooking spray; cover each baking dish with foil, sprayed side down.
6. Bake about 50 minutes or until enchiladas are hot. Use reserved 2 tablespoons sour cream to drizzle over enchiladas.

## Notes
Serves 12.

- If enchiladas are done before guests arrive, cover baking dishes with foil and keep warm in 200°F oven for up to 30 minutes.
- Provide additional toppings like sour cream, chopped cilantro or sliced ripe olives for guests to customize their Easy Chicken Enchiladas.
- If desired, you can substitute 2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the chicken breasts. The cook time will be about the same.
