Spaghetti with cream sauce is one of those simple pleasures. Is there anyone who’d turn down a big bowl of rich, velvety noodles? Surely not, although adding meatballs and a kick of heat and lemon certainly makes it that much more crave-able. Which is exactly what we’re doing: taking a tried-and-true Italian American classic and swapping in a scalliony, peppery, lemon cream sauce topped with tender, savory meatballs. Now that’s amore!

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 1 lemon
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1/2 panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 2 garlic cloves
- 12 ounce spaghetti
- 8 ounce [[Cream Sauce Base (HelloFresh)]]
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1 tbsp [[Tuscan Heat Spice Blend]]
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Zest and quarter lemon. Peel and mince or grate garlic.
2. In a medium bowl, combine beef*, panko, half the scallion greens, ketchup, 2 TBSP water, juice from two lemon wedges, 1 tsp salt, and pepper. • Form into 16 to 20 one-inch meatballs. Place meatballs on a lightly oiled baking sheet.
3. Roast meatballs on top rack until browned and cooked through, 14-16 minutes.
4. Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic, scallion whites, and half the lemon zest; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. • Stir in cream sauce base, stock concentrate, Tuscan Heat Spice, and ½ cup reserved cooking water. Bring to a simmer, then remove pan from heat. Add 3 TBSP butter; taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. Add drained spaghetti and meatballs to pan with sauce; toss to coat. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until everything is coated in a creamy sauce. • Divide pasta between bowls and season with pepper. Top with remaining scallion greens and remaining lemon zest to taste. Serve with a squeeze of lemon juice.
