## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ onion, chopped
- ¼ cup melted butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 ½ cups coarsely chopped broccoli florets
- 1 cup matchstick-cut carrots
- 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
- 2 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste


## Directions
1. Gather all ingriendents.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
3. Whisk 1/4 cup melted butter and flour together in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to whisk and cook, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk if necessary to keep the flour from burning, 3 to 4 minutes.
4. Gradually add milk while whisking constantly; stir in chicken stock and bring to a simmer.
5. Cook until mixture is thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes.
6. Add broccoli, carrots, celery, and sautéed onion; simmer until all the vegetables are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
7. Stir in Cheddar cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.
