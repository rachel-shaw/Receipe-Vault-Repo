We’re helping you get one big step closer to slow-cooked perfection with our ready-to-heat pulled chicken. We’ve already taken care of making the meat pull-apart tender; you’ve just got to warm it up with some spices for extra flavor. You’ll be serving it on top of fluffy jasmine rice with some fresh tomato salsa and sour cream to keep things cool.

## Ingredients
- 560g chicken, shredded
- 2 tsp oil
- 1 red onion, sliced
- 2 scallions
- 2 green bell peppers, sliced
- 2 Roma tomatoes, diced
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 2 tbsp [[Fajita Spice Blend]]
- 1 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- ½ tbsp butter
- ½ Monterey jack cheese, shredded
- 120g cooked rice

## Directions
1. Sauté bell peppers and onion in pan with oil until just softened, 3-4 mins. 
2. Add shredded chicken and season with salt, pepper, and fajita seasoning until chicken is warm. 
3. Stir in stock concentrate and ½ cup water; bring to a boil then reduce heat to low and stir in butter. 
4. While chicken simmers, place tomato and scallions in small bowl. 
5. Add lime juice and season with salt and pepper. 
6. Eat meat and veggies over rice.

## Notes
Use shredded chicken. 
Serves 4.
