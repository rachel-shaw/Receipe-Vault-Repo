Does your love for pasta know no bounds? Well, here’s a recipe that’s sure to please anyone who is a nut for noodles. Slivers of bell pepper, crumbled pork sausage, and a flavorful tomato sauce are tossed with spaghetti, coming together in a combination that’s hearty, satisfying, and classically comforting. Just add a sprinkle of Parmesan over the top to take things toward Italian-style bliss.

## Ingredients
- 1 yellow onion
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1/4 ounce parsley
- 28 ounce whole peels tomatoes
- 2 tbsp [[Tuscan Heat Spice Blend]]
- 18 ounce Sweet Italian pork sausage
- 12 ounce whole wheat spaghetti
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1/2 parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion from pole to pole into strands. Core and seed bell pepper, then cut into thin strips. Mince parsley. Place tomatoes in a medium bowl and break up with your hands into small pieces.
2. Heat 4 tsp oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and half the Tuscan heat spice. Cook, tossing, until lightly softened, 3-4 minutes.
3. Remove sausage from casings. Add sausage and a large drizzle of oil to pan with veggies, breaking up meat into pieces. Cook, tossing occasionally, until sausage is cooked through and browned at edges, about 5 minutes.
4. Once water boils, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Carefully scoop out and reserve 3 cups pasta cooking water, then drain.
5. Meanwhile, once sausage is browned, add tomatoes to pan. Season with salt, pepper, and remaining Tuscan heat spice, then give everything a stir. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer until pasta is done. After you've drained spaghetti, stir 2 cups pasta cooking water and stock concentrates into pan. Continue simmering until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.
6. Add spaghetti to pan, tossing to coat. (TIP: Add more pasta cooking water if needed to give sauce a loose consistency.) Stir in 2 TBSP butter, half the parsley, and half the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls, then sprinkle with remaining parsley and Parmesan.
