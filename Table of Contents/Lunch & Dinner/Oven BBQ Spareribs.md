Our favorite sparerib recipe in college :)

## Ingredients
- 4 lbs. spareribs 
- 1 lemon or just the juice 
- 2 med. onions  
- 1 c. ketchup  
- 1/3 c. Worcestershire sauce  
- 1 tsp. chili powder  
- 1 tsp. salt  
- 2 c. water  
- 2 dashes Tabasco sauce


## Directions
1. Using a large oven pan place spareribs (cut in serving pieces) in bottom. On each piece place a slice of onions and a slice of lemon. Cook in 450 degree oven for 30 minutes.
2. Prepare the rest of the ingredients for sauce, bring to a boil. After the ribs have cooked at 450 degrees for 30 minutes, reduce oven to 350 degrees. Pour sauce over ribs and cook covered for 45 minutes then uncover and cook an additional 15 minutes. Use a blue roaster if you have one or similar pan. Better not to pile the ribs on top of each other too much. 4 to 6 servings.

## Notes
We like to use the crockpot

4-6 Servings
