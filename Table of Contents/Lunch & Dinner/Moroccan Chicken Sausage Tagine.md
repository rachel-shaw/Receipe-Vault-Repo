Discover a world of flavor from the comfort of your kitchen: for this meal, we’re headed to Morocco with a sweet and savory sausage tagine over couscous. This stew-like dish is the definition of hearty and features ingredients like carrots, chickpeas, and apricots. After everything gets a quick sauté in the pan, warm spices and chicken broth are added to make things as cozy and filling as can be.

## Ingredients
- 2 shallots
- 4 cloves garlic
- 12 ounces carrots
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 2 ounces dried apricot
- 1/2 cilantro
- 26.8 ounce chickpeas
- 2 lemons
- 4 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 1 cup couscous
- 18 ounces Italian chicken sausage
- 2 tbsp [[Turkish Spice Blend]]
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Halve, peel, and mince shallot. Mince or grate garlic. Trim, peel, and thinly slice carrots on a diagonal. Dice tomato. Roughly chop apricots, if necessary. Finely chop cilantro leaves and stems. Drain and rinse chickpeas. Quarter lemon.
2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the shallot and half the garlic. Cook, stirring, until just softened, 1-3 minutes. Stir in 1½ cup water, half the stock concentrates, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then add couscous. Cover and remove from heat. Let stand until ready to serve.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and half the Turkish Spice. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until sausage is browned and cooked through, 5-7 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.
4. Heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add carrots. Cook, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, 5-7 minutes. Add a big pinch of salt and remaining shallot, garlic, and Turkish Spice. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine ⅔ cup water and remaining stock concentrates.
5. Pour stock mixture into pan with veggies. Stir in sausage, chickpeas, and tomato. Bring to a low simmer, then cover pan. (TIP: If your pan doesn’t have a lid, cover with aluminum foil.) Cook until liquid has reduced slightly, 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a second small bowl, combine sour cream, a pinch of salt, and as much hot sauce as you like. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
6. Fluff couscous with a fork, then stir in 2 TBSP butter, half the cilantro, and a squeeze of lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. 
7. Divide between plates and top with tagine. Top with sauce, apricots, and remaining cilantro. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
