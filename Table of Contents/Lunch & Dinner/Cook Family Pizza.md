This is the way Fred and Denise Cook make pizza. The sauce is from me.

## Ingredients
**Ingredients for Dough**
- 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour (may need a little more depending on the weather).
- 1 cup warm water (100F or so).  Cool enough that you can put a finger in it but it feels warm.
- 1 envelope active dry yeast (or 2 1/4 tsps).  I buy it in a jar and keep it in the fridge. Can also use instant yeast.
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup olive oil (depends on the humidity - you would probably need less).

Or use [[Wood Fire Pizza Dough]] recipe.

**Ingredients for Pizza**
- [[Pizza Sauce]]
- mozzarella cheese
- additional toppings you would like


## Directions
**Pizza Dough**
1. Add sugar and yeast to the warm water, stir and leave for 5 minutes.  This is called proofing the yeast and is how you check that it will work. (See [[Proofing Yeast]])
2. In the meantime, put the flour and salt into the mixer.  Once the yeast/water is foamy add to the mixer and beat, adding olive oil.  If it is very sticky add a little more flour.  If quite dry add a little water.  It varies according to the weather!
3. Oil a cookie sheet and turn the dough onto it.  Make a ball. Divide into three portions and roll each one on the oiled surface so it will not stick.  Cover with clear wrap and let sit for a couple of hours until risen.  Punch  down and prepare dough circles for pizza.
4. Fred sometimes rolls it but usually just pulls it into shape.  He precooks the dough crust alone at 400 to 450 till brown.  Then brings it out to make the pizza.  He cooks the pizza in low broil  in the middle of the oven until bubbly and cooked.

**Pizza**
1. Place oven rack in next to top position.  
2. Preheat stone or pan to 400F+. At least 20 minutes. Get it hot!
3. Set oven to low broil or adjust rack height.  
4. Roll out/stretch pizza dough and place on pan/stone.
5. Cook dough until just barely the level of brown that you want on the BOTTOM of your pizza. (5 -10 minutes)
6. Remove (a peel helps) from oven and invert. That is, the brown side is now down.
7. Make pizza, a bit less sauce than you think (maybe 2 Tbls) and, perhaps, a bit more cheese. For a pretty crust, brush or spray the bare dough with a bit of olive oil.
8. Place in oven and bake – typically about five to ten minutes. Depending on how hot and how close, it won’t take long and you can, if you wish, get a nice scorch.

## Notes
This is a fairly thin crust. You can also use the [[Wood Fire Pizza Dough]] recipe for the dough.
