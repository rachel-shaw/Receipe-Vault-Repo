## Ingredients
- 4 slices whole wheat bread OR 1 1/3 cups bread crumbs
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 4 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 egg whites
- 1/2 cup skim milk
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 (6-ounce) skinless boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to 1/2 inch thickness
- olive oil cooking spray
- 1 jar good-quality marinara sauce (about 3.5 cups)
- 3/4 cup (3-ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
- 2 tbsp (1/2 ounce) shredded parmesan


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Place the bread in the bowl of a food processor and process until fine crumbs are formed, about 25-30 seconds. Put the crumbs on a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes, until golden. You will end up with around 1 1/3 cups toasted crumbs.
3. In a medium bowl, toss the crumbs with oregano, garlic powder, paprika, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. 
4. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and milk together.
5. In a third bowl, stir together the flour, and the remaining 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper.
6. Dip each piece of chicken, 1 piece at a time, in flour, shaking off excess, then egg, then bread crumbs, shaking off excess.
7. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees. Place breaded breasts in a glass baking dish and spray on each side with cooking spray, about 5 seconds per side. Bake breasts until cooked through and crumbs are browned, about 15 minutes.
8. Top with marinara sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan and return to oven for an additional 10 minutes, until cheese is bubbling.
