Our chefs believe creating the perfect patty is like writing a hit song: Pack it with the right ingredients and it sings. Tonight’s patties open with ground beef, then build to a stunning chorus thanks to ginger, garlic, and soy sauce. And if you’re looking for that key change, we’ve got the sauce for you—a creamy ginger scallion aioli, sweet Thai chili sauce and crispy fried onions. This meal wouldn't be complete without a side of sweet potato wedges to dip into any extra aioli. Now that’s a Top 40 burger!

## Ingredients
- 4 sweet potatoes
- 4 scallions
- 2 thumbs ginger
- 2 garlic cloves
- 8 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 4 potato buns
- 2 ounce sweet Thai chili sauce
- 2 scoops crispy fried onions
- 1/2 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut sweet potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Toss on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until tender and slightly crispy, 25-30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, trim and mince scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel ginger and grate using a zester or the small holes of a box grater until you have 1½ tsp. Peel and mince or grate garlic.
3. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, scallion greens, 1½ tsp soy sauce, ½ tsp grated ginger, ½ tsp sugar, and a pinch of garlic.
4. In a large bowl, gently combine beef*, scallion whites, half the remaining soy sauce (all for 4 servings), remaining grated ginger, and remaining garlic. • Form into four patties, each slightly wider than a burger bun.
5. When sweet potatoes have 10 minutes left, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. • While burgers cook, halve and toast buns.
6. Spread cut sides of buns with aioli (save some for dipping), then fill with patties, chili sauce, and crispy fried onions. • Divide burgers and sweet potato wedges between plates. Serve with remaining aioli on the side for dipping.
