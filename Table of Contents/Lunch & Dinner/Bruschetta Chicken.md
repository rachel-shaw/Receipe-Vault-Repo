Bruschetta, or to some, “broo-sketta,” is one of those foods that’s just as fun to say as it is to eat. The delicious mixture of chopped juicy tomatoes, lemon juice, and fresh herbs—usually piled on top of bread—is pretty tough to beat. So our chefs decided to give it a delicious upgrade. This recipe swaps bread (which, let’s be honest, usually gets a bit soggy!) for golden, panko-and-mozzarella-coated chicken cutlets. On the side, there’s creamy mashed potatoes studded with bits of crispy bacon and roasted broccoli tossed with bright lemon zest. One bite will transport you to the Italian countryside.

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce potatoes
- 16 ounces broccoli florets
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 20 ounces chicken cutlets
- 8 ounces bacon
- 1 lemon
- 2 tomatoes
- 1/4 ounce parsley
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 1 tbsp cooking oil
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 5 tbsp butter
- salt and pepper


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces if necessary. • Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) in a medium microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Stir in mozzarella, panko, 1 tsp Italian Seasoning (2 tsp for 4), salt, and pepper. (Use the rest of the Italian Seasoning as you like.)
2. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray. • Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Place on one side of prepared sheet (for 4 servings, spread chicken out across entire sheet). Mound mozzarella crust onto tops of chicken, pressing firmly to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).
3. Toss broccoli on opposite side of sheet from chicken with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, toss broccoli on a second baking sheet; roast on middle rack.) • Roast on top rack until chicken is cooked through and broccoli is tender, 15-20 minutes. TIP: For a deeply golden crust, broil chicken for the last 2-3 minutes.
4. Place potatoes in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. • Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. Keep covered off heat until ready to mash. • While potatoes cook, place bacon* in a large, dry pan over medium-high heat. Cook, turning occasionally, until crispy, 6-10 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.
5. While potatoes and bacon cook, finely dice tomato. Pick parsley leaves from stems; finely chop leaves. Zest and quarter lemon. • In a small bowl, combine tomato, chopped parsley, a big squeeze of lemon juice, and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. Mash potatoes with sour cream and 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4 servings) until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. • Roughly chop bacon; add half to mashed potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. • Sprinkle broccoli with lemon zest to taste. • Divide mashed potatoes, broccoli, and chicken between plates. Spoon tomato topping over chicken; top potatoes with remaining bacon. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
