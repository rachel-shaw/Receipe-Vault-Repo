No matter the weather, we firmly believe that there’s nothing better than homey, comforting classics that warm you from the inside out. If you wholeheartedly agree, look no further! Enter our chefs’ ode to the classic shepherd’s pie. The base is a rich, tomatoey beef filling chock-full of fresh veggies and herbs. On top, swoops of creamy mashed potatoes are sprinkled with sharp white cheddar, then broiled to create an irresistibly cheesy crust. It all bakes up in one dish, making it easy as... well, you get it!

## Ingredients
- 24 ounce gold potatoes
- 5 ounce celery
- 2 ounce dried thyme
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 3 ounce tomato paste
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 cup white cheddar cheese
- 6 ounce carrots
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 4 tsp beef stock concentrate
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Heat broiler to high. Wash and dry produce. • Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Trim, peel, and halve carrot lengthwise; slice crosswise into ¼-inch-thick half-moons. Finely dice celery. Halve, peel, and finely chop onion.
2. Place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. • Drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with sour cream and 3 TBSP butter until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of water as needed. Season generously with salt and pepper. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. While potatoes cook, heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. Add carrot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. • Add celery, onion, and a large drizzle of oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until veggies are just tender, 5-7 minutes. TIP: If veggies begin to brown too quickly, add a splash of water. • Stir in garlic powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.
4. Add beef* to pan with veggies; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Add tomato paste and flour; cook, stirring, until thoroughly combined, 1 minute.
5. Gradually pour ¾ cup water into pan with beef mixture. • Stir in stock concentrates and bring to a boil. Cook until mixture is very thick, 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat. • Taste and season with salt and pepper. TIP: If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer mixture now to a baking dish.
6. Top beef filling with an even layer of mashed potatoes, leaving a gap around edge of pan. Evenly sprinkle with cheddar. • Broil until browned, 3-4 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning. • Serve directly from pan.
