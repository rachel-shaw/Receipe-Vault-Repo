Sure, whipping up risotto requires a little extra attention (and stirring), but the results are beyond worth it. Luckily, our chefs have made nailing it easier—and tastier—than ever. This version is chock full of savory pork sausage, tender roasted bell pepper, garlic, and Italian spices. For a finishing touch, nutty Parmesan and a squeeze of lemon juice are swirled in and it’s topped off with a sprinkle of scallion greens. We know, we know: We had you at “risotto.”

## Ingredients
- 4 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 2 scallions
- 2 bell peppers
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon
- 18 ounce pork sausage
- 1.5 cup Arborio rice
- 1/2 parmesan cheese (shredded)
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 3 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • In a large pot, combine stock concentrates and 7 cups water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Halve, core, and slice bell pepper into ½-inch-thick strips. Quarter lemon.
2. Remove sausage from casing; discard casing. • Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Turn off heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a paper-towel-lined plate, leaving as much oil in pan as possible.
3. Heat pan with reserved oil over medium heat; add scallion whites, garlic, rice, and 1 tsp Italian Seasoning. (You’ll use more Italian Seasoning later.) Cook, stirring, until scallion whites are softened and rice is translucent, 1-2 minutes. TIP: If pan seems dry, add another drizzle of olive oil. • Add ½ cup stock; stir, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until liquid has mostly absorbed.
4. Repeat process with remaining stock—adding ½ cup at a time and stirring until liquid has mostly absorbed—until rice is al dente and mixture is creamy, 25-30 minutes. TIP: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need a little more or a little less liquid.
5. While risotto simmers, toss bell pepper on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil and 1½ tsp Italian Seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until softened and lightly charred, 15-20 minutes.
6. Once risotto is done, stir in sausage, roasted bell pepper, half the Parmesan, and 3 TBSP butter. Add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste and season with salt and pepper. • Divide between bowls and sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining Parmesan. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
