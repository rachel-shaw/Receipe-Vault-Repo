One of our favorite ways to add tons of flavor to any protein in mere minutes? Whipping up a delectable glaze. Here, we blend tangy, barbecue-like hoisin sauce with aromatic garlic powder, then pour the mixture over steak during the last few minutes of cooking for deliciously sticky-sweet results. More of the glaze is drizzled over the steak just before serving for good measure; then, it’s all paired with fluffy rice, ponzu roasted green beans, and spicy mayo. Now THAT’S what we call a winning dinner!

## Ingredients
- 4 scallions
- 12 ounce green beans
- 4 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 20 ounce ranch steak
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 12 mL Ponzu sauce
- 2 tbsp sesame seeds
- 2 tbsp butter


## Directions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Trim green beans if necessary. • In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine hoisin, ½ tsp garlic powder, and 2 TBSP water. (You’ll use more garlic powder later.) Microwave hoisin glaze until warmed through, 30 seconds.
2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites; cook until softened, 1 minute. • Stir in rice, 1½ cup water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. While rice cooks, toss green beans on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 10-12 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, pat steak* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook to desired doneness, 3-6 minutes per side. Add half the hoisin glaze; turn steak to coat. Transfer to a cutting board. Let rest at least 5 minutes, then thinly slice against the grain.
5. Meanwhile, in a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise, remaining garlic powder to taste, and as much Sriracha as you like. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
6. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 2 TBSP butter and season with salt and pepper. Toss green beans with ponzu and half the sesame seeds. • Divide rice, green beans, and steak between plates. Drizzle steak with remaining hoisin glaze; drizzle everything with as much Sriracha mayo as you like. Top with scallion greens and as many remaining sesame seeds as you like. Serve.
