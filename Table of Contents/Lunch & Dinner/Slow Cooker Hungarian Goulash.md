This Hungarian goulash recipe made with ketchup and brown sugar was given to me by my aunt. It takes a while to make, but it is worth it. I hope you like it. Serve over spaetzle or rice.

## Ingredients
- 2 pounds beef chuck roast, cubed
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 ¼ cups water, divided
- ½ cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons Hungarian sweet paprika
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour


## Directions
1. Place beef in a slow cooker and cover with onion. Stir together 1 cup water, ketchup, Worcestershire, brown sugar, salt, paprika, and mustard in a medium bowl. Pour mixture over beef and onion.
2. Cover and cook on Low until meat is tender, 9 to 10 hours.
3. Mix remaining 1/4 cup water with flour in a small bowl to form a paste; stir into goulash. Cook on High until sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes.

## Notes
Serves 6.
