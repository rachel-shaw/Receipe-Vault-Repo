We’re big fans of baking, rather than frying, our meatballs for a healthier alternative to this dinnertime staple. But don’t worry, the dish is still jam-packed with flavor thanks to a sweet hoisin glaze, roasted sweet potatoes, and crispy veggies. One bite and you’ll be hooked.

## Ingredients
- 1 thumb ginger
- 2 scallions
- 24 ounce sweet potatoes
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 1/2 panko breadcrumbs
- 12 ounce baby broccoli
- 3 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 2 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Halve the sweet potatoes lengthwise, then thinly slice into ¼-inch half moons. Peel and mince the ginger. Thinly slice the scallions, then chop until finely minced.
2. Roast the sweet potatoes: Toss the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet with 1 Tablespoon oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place in the oven for about 20 minutes, flipping once, until golden brown.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the ginger, scallions, beef, panko, and 2 teaspoons sugar. Season with salt (we used 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt) and pepper. Form into 1-inch meatballs, and place onto one side of a lightly oiled baking sheet.
4. Place the broccolini on the opposite side of the baking sheet with the meatballs. Toss with a large drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place in the oven for 15 minutes, until tender and slightly crispy.
5. Glaze the meatballs: After 15 minutes, glaze each meatball with a little hoisin sauce. Remove the broccolini from the baking sheet, then return to the oven for about 5 minutes.
6. Finish and serve: Cut the lime into wedges. Serve the meatballs with the broccolini and sweet potatoes on the side. Squeeze over a lime wedge and enjoy!
