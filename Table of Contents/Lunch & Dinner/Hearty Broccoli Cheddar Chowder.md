## Ingredients
- 24 ounce potatoes
- 16 ounce broccoli florets
- 4 scallions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp [[Fry Seasoning]]
- 8 ounce [[Cream Sauce Base (HelloFresh)]]
- 2 ounce cheese roux concentrate (may not need this if creating the base above)
- 4 tsp veggies stock concentrate
- 1 cup cheddar cheese
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp dijon mustard


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Place in a medium pot (large pot for 4 servings) with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches; bring to a boil and cook until tender, 10-12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. While potatoes cook, cut broccoli into 1-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate garlic.
3. Place broccoli and 4 TBSP water in a large microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave until tender, 3-4 minutes. Carefully remove plastic wrap and drain.
4. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites, garlic, and Fry Seasoning. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. • Stir in cream sauce base, cheese roux, stock concentrates, and 4 cups water. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 1 minute.
5. Stir broccoli, potatoes, cheddar, sour cream, and mustard into same pot until fully combined and cheese is incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (TIP: If your potatoes aren’t finished cooking yet, just stir them in when they’re tender.) Remove from heat.
6. Divide soup between bowls; garnish with scallion greens. Serve.
