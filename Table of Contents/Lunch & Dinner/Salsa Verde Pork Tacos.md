The week just isn’t complete without a taco night. If you agree (and how could you not?), you’re in luck! Our chefs put together a Tex-Mex-style taco that’s sure to satisfy. There’s pork and poblano pepper simmered in tangy salsa verde, fresh tomato salsa, Southwest-spiced crema, and Monterey Jack cheese all piled into steamy-soft tortillas. Taco’bout a killer meal.

## Ingredients
- 2 roma tomatoes
- 4 scallions
- 2 poblano peppers
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tbsp [[Southwest Spice Blend]]
- 20 ounce Old El Paso Mild Green Chile Enchilada Sauce 
- 20 ounce ground pork
- 12 flour tortillas
- 1/2 Monterey jack cheese
- 2 tbsp butter

## Directions
1. Wash and dry all produce. • Finely dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Core, deseed, and dice poblano.
2. In a small bowl, combine sour cream, 2 tsp Southwest Spice, salt, and pepper. (You’ll use the rest of the Southwest Spice later.) Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. • In a separate small bowl, combine tomato, scallion whites, and 2 TBSP green chile enchilada sauce (You’ll use more enchilada sauce later.) Season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 4-6 minutes.
4. Add pork and another drizzle of oil to same pan. Season with remaining Southwest Spice, salt, and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until pork is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.
5. Add 2 cup green chile enchilada sauce to pan with pork; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in 2 TBSP butter until melted. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
6. Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds. • Divide tortillas between plates and fill with pork filling, Monterey Jack, salsa, and crema. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.
