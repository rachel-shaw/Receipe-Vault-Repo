Combining tender meat, crunchy pickled veggies, fresh cilantro, spicy chiles, and creamy spreads, the Vietnamese banh mi is one of our all-time favorite sandwiches. Here, we take all those same flavors and textures and channel them into some seriously delicious tacos. Tangy-sweet beef is piled into warm tortillas with sautéed carrots, pickled cucumber, cilantro, and Sriracha mayo. Taco ’bout an epic dinner!

## Ingredients
- 2 limes
- 2 mini cucumbers
- 1/2 ounce cilantro
- 20 ounce ground beef
- 10 tsp rice wine vinegar
- 8 ounce shredded carrots
- 8 tbsp sweet soy glaze
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 12 flour tortillas
- 1 tsp sugar


## Directions
1. Wash and dry produce. • Halve lime. Trim and halve cucumber lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons. Finely chop cilantro.
2. In a small bowl, combine half the vinegar (you’ll use the rest later), juice from half the lime, 1 tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt. • Stir in cucumber. Set aside to quick-pickle.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add carrots and cook, stirring, until just tender, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. • Turn off heat; transfer to a plate.
4. Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add beef*; season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in sweet soy glaze and remaining vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then immediately turn off heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
5. In a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise with Sriracha to taste. Season with salt. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
6. Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds. • Divide tortillas between plates and fill with saucy beef, carrots, pickled cucumber (draining first), and cilantro. Drizzle with Sriracha mayo. Cut remaining lime into wedges and serve on the side.
