This homemade BBQ sauce recipe for chicken is not-too-sweet, not-too-tangy, and finishes in almost a glaze. Everyone loves it! It would also be great on pork chops or ribs.

## Ingredients
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 5 tablespoons ketchup
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves


## Directions
1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in ketchup, honey, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper; simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, about 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside to cool slightly.
3. Dip chicken in sauce to coat on both sides; reserve remaining sauce in the skillet. Transfer chicken onto the preheated grill and cook, turning once, until nicely browned on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Return chicken to the skillet with sauce; simmer over medium heat until sticky, about 5 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
